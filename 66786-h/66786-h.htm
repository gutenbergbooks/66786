<p>The inauguration of the law requiring horseshoers to be examined
emphasizes the need of a brief and easily understood text-book on
theoretical and practical horseshoeing. At the request of the <i>Royal
Veterinary Commission</i>, in charge of the Royal Veterinary School
in Dresden, and many interested individuals, I have attempted to meet
this need by condensing within the narrowest possible limits all that
is essential to the horseshoer in the practice of his profession.
The subject-matter has been cast into a logically arranged course of
instruction; all that is superfluous and is found only in exhaustive
treatises on shoeing has been omitted.</p>

<p>In order to make this elementary text-book more easy to understand,
numerous instructive illustrations have been incorporated, which were
taken partly from “Der Fuss des Pferdes,” by Leisering &amp; Hartmann,
fifth edition, Dresden, 1882; partly from the journal <i>Der
Hufschmied</i>, and partly from drawings made specially for this work.</p>

<p>With the desire that this little book may find many friends and supply
them with valuable information, it is herewith given to the public.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r25" />

<p>During the past nine years in which it has been my privilege to teach
horseshoeing to students of veterinary medicine in the University of
Pennsylvania, and to classes of horseshoers under the auspices of the
Master Horseshoers’ National Protective Association of America, I
have been forcibly impressed with the urgent need of a text-book of
horseshoeing that is adapted to the needs of beginners. In my opinion,
such a work must present a detailed description of the anatomy and
physiology of the legs below the middle of the cannons, and must
emphasize in unmistakable terms the definite relations which exist
between certain well-defined forms of the hoof and certain well-defined
standing positions of the limb. Only on this sure foundation can a
thoroughly scientific system of shoeing be based. Furthermore, the
teachings must be eminently practical, logically arranged, as brief as
is consistent with clearness, easy of comprehension by persons who are
unfamiliar with technical language, profusely illustrated, and moderate
in price.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of my respected friend and former teacher,
Professor A. Lungwitz, one of the highest authorities in all matters
pertaining to shoeing, and for many years a teacher in and the Director
of what I believe to be the best school of shoeing in the world, I am
enabled to present to the public this translation of his text-book
for students of shoeing. Written to meet requirements identical with
those existing today in the United States, and in scope and arrangement
exactly suited to both student and teacher, I am confident that it will
meet the favor that it merits.</p>

</div>
<hr class="r25" />

<p>Since the publication in 1904 of a translation of the tenth edition
of <i>Der Lehrmeister im Hufbeschlag</i>, Prof. Anton Lungwitz, the
author, having reached the age of retirement has withdrawn from the
activities of the <i>Royal Saxon Shoeing School</i>, and has expressed
a desire that the translator assume entire responsibility for future
editions.</p>

<p>To note the progress of farriery during the past ten years many
chapters have been revised, necessitating resetting, and sixty-nine new
illustrations have been added and many redrawn. It has seemed desirable
to discuss the effect of weight in the shoe in altering the flight of
the foot; to consider rubber pads so widely used in the United States,
and to direct attention to many innovations of more or less value, that
have appeared during recent years.</p>

<p>In preparing this edition I have had the cordial co-operation of the
publishers, to whom I hereby express deepest gratitude. I wish also to
record my appreciation for the many suggestions and other aid given me
by Mr. Franz Enge, Chief Farrier of the shoeing shop of the Veterinary
Hospital, University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p>Horseshoeing is an industry which requires, in equal degree, knowledge
and skill.</p>

<p>The word “horseshoeing” embraces various acts, especially preparing
the iron sole, the horseshoe; forming it and fitting it to the hoof,
whose ground-surface has been previously dressed in accordance with the
direction of the limb, and fastening it to the hoof by means of nails.</p>

<p>Owing to the complicated structure of the hoof, success in the practice
of horseshoeing requires a knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of
the horse’s body in general and of the foot in particular.</p>

<p id="INTRO">The object of shoeing is,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. To protect the hoof from excessive wear, and thus render the
horse continuously serviceable upon our hard roads.</p>

<p>2. To prevent slipping and falling during the winter season.</p>

<p>3. To so far remove the disadvantages of faulty positions of the
limbs that horses may render good service, and, in some cases,</p>

<p>4. To cure or improve diseased or defective hoofs or feet.</p>
</div>

<p>Horseshoeing, though apparently simple, involves many difficulties,
owing to the fact that the hoof is not an unchanging body, but
varies much with respect to form, growth, quality, and elasticity.
Furthermore, there are such great differences in the character of
ground-surfaces and in the nature of horses’ work that shoeing which
is not performed with great ability and care induces disease and makes
horses lame.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>In view of these facts, a thorough training of the young horseshoer
in the principles and practice of his trade is not only greatly to be
desired, but is really essential to success; unreasoning work does as
much harm in this as in any other vocation. <i>A good common-school
education is necessary</i> (more will do no harm). Further requisites
are a <i>healthy body</i>, not too tall, <i>liking for the work,
aptness</i>, an active, <i>reasoning mind, fearlessness, dexterity, a
good eye for proportion</i>, and, finally, <i>careful selection of a
master-instructor</i>. Theoretically educated, practically experienced
and approved masters, in whose shops all kinds of horses are shod, are
to be preferred.</p>

<p>During his term of apprenticeship the young apprentice should <i>learn
to make drawings of horseshoes, of tools of the trade</i>, and of hoofs
of various forms, and should also make <i>one or more model shoes as an
indication of his ability</i>. After completing his time he should seek
a position in a first-class shop, either at home or abroad. A visit to
foreign lands will widen one’s mental horizon and make him a broader,
abler man in every respect. Later, opportunity will be given to some
(in Germany) to join the cavalry, and thus acquire a good education
in shoeing under the patronage of the government. Finally, a course
of instruction in a school of horseshoeing will convert an already
practical and intelligent horseshoer into a thoughtful, capable, expert
workman.</p>

<p>The scope of horseshoeing is by no means so narrow and insignificant
as it may appear, and since a knowledge of the anatomy and physiology
of the horse’s body in general, and of the foot in particular, is
necessary, it is evident that the schools of horseshoeing in which one
can get the best instruction are those in which there is not only a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
regularly graded course of instruction, with demonstrations upon
dissected material and upon living horses, but also an abundance of
daily work at the forge and on the floor in the shoeing of horses. <big><b>A
course of four to six weeks is not sufficient.</b></big></p>

<p>Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that schools of horseshoeing
are not for the purpose of instructing young men in all matters which
pertain to the trade, but only in the making of shoes, the critical
examination and management of hoofs, and the rational and skilful
performance of shoeing. For this reason it is not advisable for young
men to attend a school of horseshoeing until they have at least
completed their apprenticeship.

</div>

<p>The supporting structure of the horse’s body is the <b>bony
framework</b> or skeleton (<a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, page 18).
We distinguish in the skeleton the bones of the head, trunk, and limbs.</p>

<p id="I_1">The <b>bones of the head</b> are numerous and, excepting the lower
jaw, are solidly united with one another. In general, we distinguish in
the head only the upper and lower jaws (1 and 1′). Both form various
cavities; for example, the cranial cavity, in which the brain lies,
the orbital cavities (eye-sockets), the nasal passages, and the mouth.
Besides, the teeth are set in the jaws.</p>

<p>The <b>trunk</b> comprises the bones of the spinal column, thorax,
and pelvis.</p>

<p id="I_2" class="space-below2">The <i>spinal</i> or <i>vertebral column</i>
(2 to 6), which bears the head at its anterior end, is the chief support,
of the entire skeleton. It consists of from fifty-two to fifty-four
single and irregular bones called vertebræ, placed in the upper part
of the median vertical plane of the body. Each vertebra, with the
exception of those of the tail (coccygeal or caudal vertebræ), is
traversed by a large opening called the vertebral foramen. The vertebræ
are placed end to end in a row, and through them runs a continuous
large canal called the <i>vertebral</i> or <i>spinal canal</i>, in
which lies the spinal cord. The horse has seven cervical, eighteen
dorsal, six lumbar, five sacral, and sixteen <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> to eighteen caudal vertebræ. The sacral
vertebræ are grown together to form one piece called the sacrum.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>thorax</i> is formed by the ribs and the breast-bone or sternum.
The horse has eighteen ribs on each side (7), and all articulate with
the dorsal vertebræ. The first eight pairs unite by their lower ends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
directly to the sternum or breast-bone, and are therefore called
<i>true ribs</i>, while the last ten pairs are only indirectly attached
to the sternum, and are consequently called <i>false ribs</i>. The
sternum (8) lies between the forelegs, and helps to form the floor of
the chest cavity. The space enclosed by the bones of the thorax is
called the thoracic, pulmonary, or chest cavity, and contains the heart
and lungs. The <i>bones of the pelvis</i> form a complete circle or
girdle. The upper part, called the ilium (9′), articulates on its
inner side with the sacrum (5), while its outer side is prolonged to
form a prominent angle, which is the support of the hip, and is called
the “point of the hip.” The posterior part of the pelvis is called the
ischium (9″), and that part lying between the ilium and the
ischium and forming part of the floor of the pelvis is called the pubis.</p>

<p id="I_3">The space between the thorax and the pelvis, bounded above by
the lumbar vertebræ and shut in below and on the sides by the skin and
muscular walls of the belly (abdomen), is called the <i>abdominal
cavity</i>. This cavity opens directly into the pelvic cavity, and
contains the stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and
a part of the generative organs. The thoracic and abdominal cavities
are separated by a muscular partition, the <i>diaphragm</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>bones of the limbs</b> may be likened to columns, upon which the
body rests; they articulate with one another at various angles, are
tubular in structure, and strong.</p>

<p>The bones of the <b>fore-limbs</b> <i>do not articulate directly with
the bones of the trunk</i>, but are attached to the body by means of the
skin and muscles. From above to below we distinguish the following bones:</p>

<p>1. The <i>scapula</i>, or shoulder-blade (10), a flat, triangular bone,
prolonged at its upper border by a flat, very elastic cartilage, called
the scapular cartilage. At its lower end the scapula articulates with—</p>

<p>2. The upper end of the <i>humerus</i> (11), forming the
<i>shoulder-joint</i> (scapulo-humeral articulation). The humerus
articulates at its lower end with—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>3. The <i>radius</i> (12) and the <i>ulna</i> (13), to form
the <i>elbow joint</i>. These two bones are the basis of the
<i>forearm</i>. The ulna, smaller and weaker than the radius, lies
behind and projects above it to form the point of the elbow. The lower
end of the radius articulates with—</p>

<p>4. The <i>carpus</i>, or <i>knee</i> (14), which comprises seven small,
cubical bones disposed in two horizontal rows, one above the other. The
upper row comprises four bones and the lower row three. The lower row
rests upon—</p>

<p>5. The large metacarpal or <i>cannon bone</i>, and the two rudimentary
metacarpal or <i>splint-bones</i>. The lower end of the radius,
the upper ends of the metacarpal bones, and the small carpal bones
together form the carpal or <i>knee-joint</i> (wrist of man). Of
the metacarpals, the middle one is the largest, longest, strongest,
and most important, and is called the <i>large metacarpal</i>,
<i>cannon</i>, or <i>shin-bone</i> (15). It articulates at its lower
end with the os suffraginis, or long pastern (17), and with the
two small sesamoid bones (20). On each side of the upper part of
its posterior surface lie the two long, slender splint-bones (16).
The inner splint-bone is sometimes affected with bony thickenings
(exostoses) called “splints.”</p>

<p>6. The bones of the <i>phalanges</i> (all bones below the cannon) will
be fully described in another place.</p>

<p>The bones of the <b>hind limbs</b> articulate <i>directly</i> with
the pelvis at the hip-joint. They are stronger than the bones of the
anterior limbs. We distinguish the following bones in the hind legs:</p>

<p>1. The highest bone in the hind limb is the <i>femur</i> (21). It is
the strongest bone in the entire body. It lies in an oblique direction
downward and forward, and at its lower end articulates with—</p>

<p>2. The <i>patella</i> (22), the <i>tibia</i> (23), and the
<i>fibula</i> (24), to form the <i>stifle-joint</i> (knee of man). The
patella plays over the anterior surface of the lower end of the femur.
The fibula is small, and lies against the upper and outer side of the
tibia. The latter at its lower end articulates with—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>3. The bones of the tarsus, or <i>hock</i> (25), which are six small,
irregular bones disposed in three rows, one above another. The <i>os
calcis</i>, or <i>heel-bone</i>, and the <i>astragalus</i> are in the
uppermost row, and are the most important. The former projects above
the true hock-joint from behind, to form a long lever, the upper end
of which is called the “point of the hock,” and the latter articulates
with the tibia. The tarsal (hock) bones articulate below with—</p>

<p>4. The <i>metatarsal bones</i> (26 and 27), which are longer, and the
cannon narrower from side to side, than the corresponding metacarpal
bones, but are otherwise similar.</p>

<p>5. The <i>phalanges</i> of a hind limb (28 to 31) are also narrower
than those of a fore-limb, but are nearly alike in other respects.</p>

<p id="I_4">All the horse’s bones present small, but more or less distinct
openings (nutrient foramina) for the passage of blood-vessels and
nerves. Many bones possess roughened elevations and depressions, to
which ligaments, tendons, or muscles are attached. With the exception
of the os pedis, all bones are enveloped in a sort of “bone-skin”
called <b>periosteum</b>. The bones unite among themselves to form
either <i>movable</i> or <i>immovable unions</i>. A movable union
between two or more bones is termed a “joint,” or <b>articulation</b>.
The articulating ends of the bones, presenting on one side a convex
surface (head or condyle) and on the other a corresponding concave
surface (glenoid or cotyloid cavity), are covered with elastic
<i>articular cartilage</i>. The bones are bound together by means
of <b>ligaments</b>, which are tough, fibrous, cord-like, or
sheet-like structures. Ligaments are either (1) <i>capsular</i> or (2)
<i>funicular</i> (cord-like). Every articulation in the limbs possesses
a capsular ligament, and all, except the shoulder-joint, have several
funicular (cord-like) ligaments. The capsular ligaments are lined upon
their inner face with a delicate membrane (synovial membrane) which
secretes the <i>synovia</i>, or “joint-water,” whose function is to
lubricate the joint and prevent friction; they enclose the joint in a
sort of air-tight cuff or sack. The funicular ligaments are very strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and often large, and are the chief means of union of the bones. The
immovable articulations are termed <i>sutures</i>; they are found
principally in the head. The mixed joints are found between the
bodies of the vertebræ, each two of which are united by an elastic
fibro-cartilage which, in the form of a pad, lies between them, and by
its elasticity allows of very slight movement, though the spinal column
as a whole can execute manifold and wide movements, as shown by the
neck and tail.</p>

<p>Joints which permit motion in all directions are known as <b>free
joints</b>; such are the shoulder- and hip-joints (ball-and-socket
joints). Those which admit of motion in but two directions (flexion
and extension), and often to a very limited extent, are called
<b>hinge-joints</b>,—<i>e.g.</i>, the elbow, hock, and fetlock. The
joints between the long and short pasterns and between the latter and
the pedal bone are imperfect hinge-joints, because they allow of some
other movements besides flexion and extension. The articulation between
the first and second cervical vertebræ (atlas and axis) is called a
<b>pivot-joint</b>.</p>

<p>The skeleton represents a framework which closely approaches the
external form of the body, and by reason of its hardness and stiffness
furnishes a firm foundation for all other parts of the body. By reason
of the great variety of position and direction of the bones, and of the
fact that changes of position of each single part of this complicated
system of levers may result in the greatest variety of bodily
movements, we can readily understand how the horse is enabled to move
from place to place. Of course, the bones have no power of themselves
to move, but this power is possessed by other organs that are attached
to the bones. These organs are the <b>muscles</b>, and, owing to their
ability to contract and shorten themselves, and afterwards to relax and
allow themselves to be stretched out, they furnish the motive power
that is communicated to and moves the bones.

<p>The muscles of the body massed together are the red flesh which
we observe in every slaughtered animal. They are not, however, so
shapeless as they appear while in this condition; on the contrary, they
present well-arranged muscular layers of variable size, thickness,
length, and position. (<a href="#FIG_2">See Fig. 2</a>.) The muscles clothe the skeleton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
externally, give the body its peculiar form, and, by their special
power of contraction, change the relative positions of the bones and
thus make it possible for the animal to move. For this reason, the
muscles are called the <b>active</b>, and the bones the <b>passive</b>,
organs of motion. By carefully examining a muscle it will be found to
consist of actual, minute, reddish, <i>muscular fibres</i>. As a rule,
muscles terminate in more or less strong, glistening, fibrous cords
called <b>tendons</b>, or fibrous sheets termed aponeuroses, by which
they are attached to the bones. In the limbs are muscles terminating
in very long tendons, which act as draw-lines upon the distant bones
of the foot (long and short pasterns and pedal bone) and set them in
motion. Such long tendons are enclosed in sheaths of thin, membranous
tissue, known as <i>tendon sheaths</i>. The inner surface of such
a sheath is in direct contact with the surface of the tendon, and
secretes a thin slippery fluid (synovia) which lubricates the tendon
and facilitates its gliding within the sheath.</p>

<p>As long as the bones, articulations, muscles, and tendons of the limbs
remain healthy, just so long will the legs maintain their natural
direction and position. Frequently, however, this normal condition of
the limbs is gradually altered by disease of the bones, joints, and
tendons, and defects in the form and action of the lower parts of the
limbs arise that often require attention in shoeing.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>THE FOOT.</b></p>

<h4 id="I_A_1">A. The Bones of the Foot.</h4>

<p>Since the horse is useful to man only by reason of his movements, his
foot deserves the most careful attention. The horseshoer should be
familiar with all its parts. <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a> shows the osseous framework
of the foot, consisting of the lower end of the cannon bone (<i>A</i>), the
long pastern (<i>B</i>), the two sesamoid bones (<i>C</i>), the short
pastern (<i>D</i>), and the pedal bone (<i>E</i>). The lower end of
the cannon, or large metacarpal bone (<i>A</i>) exhibits two convex
articular surfaces (condyles) separated by a median ridge running from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
before to behind, and all covered by articular cartilage. On both the
external and the internal aspects of the lower end of the cannon are
small uneven depressions in which ligaments take their attachment.</p>

<div id="FIG_3" class="figcenter">
  <p class="f150"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
  <img  src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="519" />
</div>

<p id="I_A_2">The condyles of the cannon articulate with the os suffraginis (long
pastern) and the two sesamoids (<a href="#FIG_3">Figs. 3, <i>C</i></a>, and
<a href="#FIG_4">4, <i>B</i></a>) in such a manner that in the forefeet
the cannon makes an angle with the long pastern of from one hundred and
thirty-five to one hundred and forty degrees, and in the hind feet of
from one hundred and forty to one hundred and forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>The <b>long pastern</b> (first phalanx) (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4, <i>A</i></a>)
is about one-third the length of the cannon; its upper and thicker end presents
two condyloid cavities (<i>a</i>) (glenoid cavities), separated by a
median groove, which exactly fit the condyles and ridge at the lower
end of the cannon. The lower end of the long pastern is smaller than
the upper, and is provided with two condyles, between which is a
shallow groove (<i>e</i>). The anterior face of the bone is smooth,
rounded from side to side, and blends into the lateral borders. The
posterior face is flatter, and shows a clearly marked triangle to which
ligaments attach.</p>

<p>The two <b>sesamoid bones</b> (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4, <i>B</i></a>) are small,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and somewhat pyramidal in shape, and, lying against the posterior part of
the condyles of the cannon bone, increase the articular surfaces at the
upper end of the long pastern.</p>

(<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5, <i>a</i></a>) presents two glenoid cavities to correspond
with the condyles of the first phalanx. The lower articular surface
(<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5, <i>d</i></a>) resembles the lower end of the first phalanx.
The upper posterior border of this bone is prominent and prolonged transversely
(<a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6, <i>a</i></a>), to serve as a <i>supporting ledge</i>

<p>The lowest bone of the limb is the <b>third phalanx</b> or <b>os
pedis</b> (<a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a>). In form it is similar to the hoof. The <i>anterior
or wall-surface</i> (<i>a</i>) is rough, like pumice stone. Above and
in front is the <i>pyramidal eminence</i> to which the tendon of the
anterior extensor of the phalanges attaches. Behind, the bone extends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
backward to form the <i>inner</i> and <i>outer branches</i> (<i>c,
c</i>) or wings of the os pedis. The <i>upper</i>, articular surface
(<i>b</i>) slopes backward and downward. The <i>lower</i>, solar or
plantar surface (<a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8, <i>a</i></a>) is slightly concave, and presents
posteriorly a half-moon-shaped excavation, with a roughened border
called the <i>semilunar crest (c)</i>, to which the perforans tendon
attaches; just above this crest are two small holes (<i>e</i>) known as
the <i>plantar foramina</i>, through which the plantar arteries pass
into the bone. The surfaces of wall and sole come together in a sharp
edge, which is circular in its course. It is easy to tell whether a
pedal bone is from a fore or a hind limb; the os pedis of a hind leg
has a steeper and more pointed toe, and a more strongly concaved solar
surface than the same bone of a fore-leg. Not only is the outline of the
sharp inferior border of the os pedis of a <i>front foot more rounded
at the toe</i>, but when placed on a flat surface the <i>toe does not
touch</i> by reason of being turned slightly upward, much as a shoe
designed to give a “rolling motion.” The os pedis of a <i>hind foot is
narrower from side to side</i> (pointed), and <i>does not turn up at
the toe</i>.</p>

The right and left hoof-bones are also, as a rule, easily distinguished
by variations in the surfaces of wall and sole. The shape of the os
pedis corresponds to the form of the horny box or hoof, and therefore a
knowledge of this bone is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The <b>navicular bone</b> (os naviculare, nut-bone,
<a href="#FIG_9">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#FIG_10">10</a>)
is an accessory or sesamoid bone to the os pedis. It is a small bone,
transversely elongated and situated behind and below the os pedis and
between the wings of the latter. It adds to the articular surface of
the pedal joint. Its under surface is smooth, and acts as a gliding
surface for the perforans tendon, which is quite wide at this point.</p>

<h4 id="I_B">B. The Articulations of the Foot.</h4>

<p>There are three articulations in the foot—namely, the fetlock,
coronary, and pedal joints. All are hinge-joints, the fetlock being a
perfect hinge-joint, and the other two imperfect hinge-joints. Each
has a <i>capsular ligament</i>, and also several <i>funicular</i> or
cord-like <i>ligaments</i> which are placed at the sides of (lateral
ligaments), or behind (on the side of flexion) the joints.</p>

<p id="I_B_I">I. The <b>fetlock</b> or <b>metacarpo-phalangeal articulation</b>
is formed by the condyles at the lower end of the cannon bone and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
glenoid cavities formed by the union of the articular surfaces of
the sesamoids and the upper end of the first phalanx. The following
ligaments are about this joint:</p>

<div id="FIG_11" class="figcenter">

<p>2. <i>Two lateral sesamoid ligaments</i> (<i>f</i>).</p>

<p>3. An <i>intersesamoid ligament</i> (<a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12, <i>b</i></a>),
a thick, fibrous mass, binding the sesamoid bones almost immovably together,
extending above them and presenting on its posterior face a smooth
groove, in which glide the flexor tendons of the phalanges (perforans
and perforatus).</p>

<i>c</i></a>, <a href="#FIG_12">12, <i>c</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_13">13, <i>c</i></a>,
pages 29 and 30). This may also be called the superior sesamoid
ligament. It is a long and very powerful brace, originating on the
lower row of carpal bones (bones of the hock in the hind leg) and on
the upper end of the cannon between the heads of the two splint-bones,
and dividing at the lower third of the cannon into two branches
(<i>c</i>), which are attached one to each sesamoid bone. Below these
bones these two branches are prolonged obliquely downward and forward
on opposite sides of the long pastern to pass into the borders of the
anterior extensor tendon of the toe at about the middle of the long
pastern (<a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14, <i>b′</i></a>, page 32).

<a href="#FIG_12">12, <i>d</i>, <i>d′</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_13">13, <i>d′</i>, <i>E</i></a>).
This originates at the lowest part of the sesamoid bones and intersesamoid ligament, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
consists of <i>three parts</i> or branches. The <i>median branch</i>
(<i>d</i>) is the longest and strongest, and takes its lower attachment
in the middle of the fibro-cartilaginous lip found on the upper border
of the posterior face of the second phalanx. The <i>two lateral
branches</i> (<i>d′</i>) approach each other as they descend, and
terminate on the sides of the roughened triangle on the posterior face
of the first phalanx.</p>

<p>6. The <i>deep inferior sesamoid ligament</i> (<a href="#FIG_13">Fig. 13, <i>e</i></a>)
is quite short, and consists of a number of distinct, thin fibrous bands
lying directly against the bone and entirely covered by the median and
lateral inferior sesamoid ligaments. These fibrous bands cross one
another in passing from the sesamoids to the first phalanx.</p>

<p id="I_B_II">II. The <b>coronary joint</b> is the simplest of the three
articulations of the foot. The long pastern furnishes two condyles and
the short pastern two glenoid cavities. Besides a capsular ligament
there are—</p>

<p>1. <i>Two lateral coronary ligaments</i> (<i>k</i>) and,</p>

<p>2. <i>Six posterior coronary ligaments</i>,—namely, <i>two
superior</i> coronary ligaments (<i>h</i>), <i>two median</i> coronary
ligaments (<i>h′</i>), and <i>two inferior</i> coronary ligaments
(<i>g</i>).</p>

<p id="I_B_III">III. The <b>pedal articulation</b> (“coffin” joint)
is an imperfect hinge-joint, and is formed by the condyles at the
lower end of the short pastern and the two glenoid cavities in the
united upper surfaces of the pedal and navicular bones. Besides the
<i>capsular ligament</i> (<a href="#FIG_12">Figs. 12</a> and <a href="#FIG_13">13, <i>l</i></a>),
which binds all three bones together, there are the following accessory ligaments:</p>

<p>1. <i>Two strong lateral ligaments</i>, an external and an internal
(<a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11, <i>i</i></a>), whose posterior borders are
lost in the lateral cartilages which cover them.</p>

<p>2. <i>Two lateral suspensory ligaments of the navicular bone</i>
(<i>k</i>). They begin on the posterior border and ends of the
navicular bone, and terminate on the lower part of the anterior surface
of the os suffraginis, where they are lost in the lateral ligaments of
the coronary articulation.</p>

<p>3. The <i>lateral ligaments</i> of the lateral <i>cartilages</i>,
<i>navicular bone</i>, and <i>os pedis</i>. They are short, and unite
the navicular bone with the os pedis and lateral cartilages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Of the three phalangeal articulations, the pedal is the only one that
permits of any lateral movement; hence it is an imperfect hinge-joint.</p>

<h4 id="I_C">C. The Locomotory Organs of the Foot.</h4>

<p>Though the muscles are the organs which produce motion, the
horseshoer need concern himself only with the tendons of those
muscles which extend and flex the phalanges. These tendons are
either <b>extensors</b> or <b>flexors</b>. The extensors lie on the
<i>anterior face</i> and the flexors on the <i>posterior face</i> of
the phalanges.</p>

ligament (<i>b′</i>) that come from the sesamoid bones. It takes a firm
attachment on the pyramidal eminence of the os pedis. In the forefeet
the long pastern has a special extensor tendon (<i>c</i>), which is
known as the <i>lateral extensor</i>. When the muscles to which these

and covers the deep flexor or perforans tendon. At the gliding surface
between the sesamoid bones (<a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15, <i>f</i></a>) it broadens,
and forms a ring or tube (<a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15, <i>b′</i></a>) through which
the perforans tendon (<i>a‴</i>) passes, while a short distance farther down it bifurcates,
or divides into two branches (<a href="#FIG_15">Figs. 15, <i>b″</i></a>, and
<a href="#FIG_16">16, <i>b</i></a>), which terminate, one on either

<p>If at a point a few inches above the fetlock a limb be cut through
from behind, the knife will pass successively through the following
structures: skin, perforatus tendon, perforans tendon, suspensory
ligament, cannon bone, lateral extensor tendon, anterior extensor
tendon, and, lastly, the skin on the anterior surface of the limb. The
flexor tendons are frequently thickened and shortened by inflammation
due to injury, and as a result the foot is pulled backward and the
hoof gradually becomes more nearly upright,—<i>i.e.</i>, stubby,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
steep-toed. A knowledge of the normal condition of the tendons is,
therefore, absolutely necessary to the horseshoer. Both flexor tendons
are embraced and held in place by ligaments and fascia passing out from
the phalanges (<a href="#FIG_16">Figs. 16, <i>d′</i></a>,
and <a href="#FIG_24">24, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i></a>). The
extensor and flexor tendons essentially contribute to the strong union
of the phalangeal bones, and especially to the support and stability
of the fetlock-joint. The gliding of the tendons is made easy by the
secretion of a lubricating fluid, called synovia, from the inner
surface of the sheaths which surround them. In thin-skinned well-bred
horses with sound limbs one can not only distinctly feel the tendons
through the skin, but can see their outline. <i>When the tendons and
bones are free from all inflammatory thickenings, and the tendon
sheaths are not visibly distended, we say that the leg is “clean.”</i></p>

<p id="I_C_2" class="center"><b>Mucous Bursæ and Tendon Sheaths.</b></p>

<p>Accessory to the tendons, there are in the foot roundish, membranous
sacs (mucous bursæ) and membranous tubes (tendon sheaths). Both contain
a liquid resembling synovia (“joint-water”), which facilitates the
gliding of the tendons. These bursæ and sheaths are often distended to
form soft tumors, known as hygromata (“wind-puffs,” “wind-galls”).</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Mucous Bursæ.</b>—They lie beneath tendons at those
places where the tendons pass over bony prominences.</p>

<p>1. The mucous bursa of the anterior extensor tendon of the toe is about
the size of a walnut, and lies between the tendon and the capsular
ligament of the fetlock-joint (<a href="#FIG_17">Figs. 17, <i>g</i></a>,
and <a href="#FIG_18">18, <i>e</i></a>).</p>

<p>2. The mucous bursa of the extensor tendon of the long pastern (lateral
extensor) is somewhat smaller, and lies, likewise, beneath the tendon,
between it and the capsular ligament of the fetlock-joint (<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17,
<i>h</i></a>).</p>

<p>3. The mucous bursa of the navicular region lies between the under
surface (gliding surface) of the navicular bone and the flexor pedis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
perforans tendon (deep flexor). Its width equals the length of the
navicular bone, and it extends upward and downward beyond the bone.
Above, it is separated from the sheath of the perforans tendon (“great
sesamoid sheath”) by a membranous partition; below, it passes to the
attachment of the perforans tendon to the semilunar crest of the os pedis.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There is but one tendon sheath in the foot—the sheath
common to the two flexor tendons (great sesamoid sheath). It encloses
the flexor tendons from the middle third of the cannon down to the
middle of the short pastern, and is intimately united with the flexor
pedis perforans tendon (<a href="#FIG_17">Fig. 17, <i>f</i>, <i>f′</i>, <i>f″</i>,

<p>The body-weight imposed at the fetlock-joint is supported, in large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
part, by the suspensory ligament; somewhat less weight is borne by the
perforans tendon, and a still smaller amount by the perforatus. The
coronary joint is supported chiefly by the perforatus, assisted by
the perforans. The pedal joint is pressed forward and upward by the
perforans tendon passing in a curve beneath the navicular bone. Each of
these three structures bears its normal proportion of the body-weight
when the three phalanges, as viewed from the side, form a continuous
straight line from the fetlock-joint to the ground. In such a case the
obliquity of the long pastern will be the same as that of the toe
(<a href="#Page_70">see Foot-Axis, p. 70</a>).</p>

<p><i>Raising the toe</i> by means of a tip, a full shoe with thinned

the os pedis backward, break the foot-axis backward in the pedal joint
and to a less extent in the coronary joint, and increase the tension of
the perforans tendon considerably and of the perforatus slightly. These
tendons tightening behind the fetlock-joint force it forward, causing
the long pastern to stand steeper, and taking some strain from the
suspensory ligament. Hence, <i>the perforans tendon is under greatest
tension, and the suspensory ligament under least tension, when the
foot-axis is broken strongly backward</i>.</p>

<p class="space-below2"><i>Shortening the toe, or raising the
quarters</i> by heel-calks or thickened branches, will tilt the os

will <i>greatly lessen the tension of the perforans tendon</i>.
The aggregate tension of perforans and <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> perforatus tendons being diminished, the

<p>All bodies which under pressure or traction change their form, but

<h4 id="I_E">E. The Blood-Vessels and Nerves.</h4>

<p>Vessels which carry blood from the heart to the tissues are called
<b>arteries</b>, while those which return the blood to the heart from
the tissues are called <b>veins</b>. Arteries and veins are connected
by very small, thread-like vessels called <i>capillaries</i>, which
originate in the smallest arteries and are so minute that they can not
be seen without the aid of a microscope. The capillaries penetrate the
soft tissues in every direction, and finally unite to form small veins.
For our purpose we need consider only the arteries and veins.</p>

<p id="I_E_1">The <b>arteries</b> carrying blood from the heart ramify and
subdivide in all parts of the body, and thus reach the foot. They are
thick-walled, very elastic tubes, <b>without valves</b>, and carry
<b>bright-red</b> blood, which flows in spurts, as can be seen when
an artery is cut. If a finger be pressed lightly over an artery lying
near the surface, the blood-wave can be felt as a light stroke (pulse).
The character of the pulse is important, because in inflammations of
the pododerm or horn-producing membrane of the foot we can ascertain
by feeling that the pulse is stronger than usual in the large arteries
carrying blood to the inflamed foot.</p>

<p>On either side of the phalanges below the fetlock-joint there lies an
artery called the <i>digital artery</i> (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25, <i>a</i></a>).
The pulse can be felt in it as it passes over the fetlock at <a href="#FIG_25"><i>A</i>, Fig. 25</a>.
It gives off the following collateral (side) branches: 1. The <i>artery
of the first phalanx</i> (perpendicular artery), with anterior and
posterior branches. 2. The <i>artery of the plantar cushion</i>, which
supplies with blood the plantar cushion, the velvety tissue of the
sole and frog, the bar portion of the coronary band, and the sensitive
laminæ of the bars. 3. The <i>coronary artery</i>, which carries blood
to the coronary band, os coronæ, ligaments of the coronary and pedal
joints, flexor tendons, and skin.</p>

<p>The terminal branches of the digital arteries are the <i>preplantar</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and <i>plantar ungual arteries</i>. The preplantar artery passes
through the notch in the wing of the os pedis, then along the
preplantar fissure, splitting up into many branches, which spread
over and penetrate the porous surface of the os pedis. The plantar
artery courses along the plantar fissure, enters the plantar foramen,
and passes into the semilunar sinus of the os pedis, where it unites
with the terminal branch of the opposite digital artery, forming the
<i>semilunar arch</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
After the arterial or pure blood passes through the capillaries it is
collected by the <b>veins</b>, to be returned to the heart; then it
is driven to the lungs for purification, and is again returned to the
heart, from whence it is pumped through the arteries to all parts of
the body.</p>

</div>

<p>The veins are more numerous than the arteries; they have thinner walls,
and the larger ones are provided with <b>valves</b> that prevent
the impure blood from flowing backward. The veins carry impure or
<b>dark-red</b> blood towards the heart, and if one is opened the dark
blood flows in a steady stream; it does not spurt. The great number
of veinlets in the lower parts of the foot form a complex net-work
(plexus) of vessels which are in such manifold and close union with one
another that checking the flow of blood in one part does not seriously
interfere with the flowing of the blood towards the larger veins. The
following are the most important of these net-works of veins or venous
plexuses: (1) the <i>solar venous plexus</i> (<a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26, <i>D</i></a>);
(2) the <i>podophyllous venous plexus</i> (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25, <i>C</i></a>);
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
(3) <i>superficial coronary venous plexus</i> (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25, <i>B</i></a>);
(4) <i>bulbar venous plexus</i> (<a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26, <i>B</i></a>).
All these plexuses of small veins contribute to form the <i>digital veins</i>
(<a href="#FIG_25">Figs. 25</a> and <a href="#FIG_26">26, <i>A</i></a>).</p>

<p class="space-below2"><b>Nerves</b> are roundish white cords which
come from the brain and spinal cord; they generally accompany arteries.
They divide and subdivide into smaller and smaller branches till
they become invisible to the naked eye and are lost in the tissues.
The nerves that are found in the foot come from the spinal cord, and
because the largest nerves of the foot accompany the digital arteries
they are called <i>digital nerves</i> (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25, 1</a>). The
branches ramify throughout all parts of the foot except the horny box and the
hair. Nerves, according to their use or function, are classed as
<i>motor</i> and <i>sensory</i>. The motor nerves end in muscles which
they stimulate to action and control. The sensory nerves terminate
in the skin and in the soft tissues just under the horny box or hoof
(pododerm), and render these parts sensitive; that is, they convey
certain feelings, as, for example, the pain caused by bruising,
pricking, or close-nailing, to the brain and consciousness.</p>

<h4 id="I_F">F. The Protective Organs of the Foot.</h4>

<p>The protective organs are the skin and the horny box or hoof.</p>

<p>The <i>external skin</i>, or <i>hide</i>, covers the entire body; in
the feet it covers the bones, tendons, and ligaments, even passing
in under the hoof and directly covering the os pedis. This portion
of the skin, enclosed by the hoof and therefore invisible, is called
the <i>pododerm</i> or foot-skin. In Germany it is called the
<i>hoof-skin</i> (huflederhaut), because it is a continuation of the
outer visible skin, and because it secretes the hoof,—that is, the
hoof is produced by it. That part of the skin which is covered with
hair is known as the external or <i>hair-skin</i>.</p>

<p id="I_F_A">(<i>a</i>) <b>The hair-skin</b> (<a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27, <i>a</i></a>)
consists of <i>three</i> superposed <i>layers</i>,—(1) the <i>external</i>
superficial layer, or <i>epidermis</i>; (2) the <i>middle</i> layer,
<i>derm</i> or leather-skin (so-called because leather is made from
it); (3) the <i>internal</i> layer, or <i>subcutaneous connective tissue</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p id="I_F_A_1">1. The <i>external layer</i>, or <i>epidermis</i>, is composed
merely of single flattened, horn-like cells (scales) lying side by side and
over one another, and uniting to form one entire structure,—a thin,
horn-like layer, without blood-vessels or nerves. It extends over the
entire surface of the body, and protects the underlying, very sensitive
middle layer from external influences. The oldest cell-layers lie on
the outer surface, and are being continuously brushed off in patches or
scales, while new ones are constantly being formed on the outer surface
of the middle layer.</p>

<p id="I_F_A_2">2. The <i>middle layer</i>, <i>leather-skin</i> or <i>dermis</i>,
is composed of solid, fibrous, and elastic tissues, and contains many
blood-vessels, small nerves, sweat-and oil-glands, and hair follicles
from which the hair grows. The hair upon the posterior surface of
the fetlock-joint is usually long and coarse, forming a tuft known
as the “foot-lock,” which encloses a horny spur, called the ergot.
Common-bred horses have, as a rule, larger and coarser footlocks than
thoroughbreds. The derm or leather-skin, which produces the hair and
epiderm, is the thickest and most important layer of the skin.</p>

<p id="I_F_A_3">3. <i>The inner layer, or subcutaneous tissue</i>, unites the
middle layer with the muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, or other structures.
It is that loose fibrous mesh or net-work through which the butcher
cuts in removing the hide from the carcass.</p>

     vertical section of the skin prolonged downward through
     the pododerm (foot-skin) to show clearly that the latter

</div>

<p>In order to study the pododerm we should not wrench the hoof off with
violence, but should allow the foot to partially decompose by leaving
it for six to eight days at ordinary room temperature; it can then
be removed without injuring the pododerm. After the hoof has been
removed the entire pododerm presents a more or less dark-red color
(flesh-color), which is due to the great number of blood-vessels that
it contains. For this reason different parts of the pododerm have
received the prefix “fleshy,” as for example, fleshy wall, fleshy sole,
fleshy frog, etc. The pododerm is what the uninformed horseshoer calls
the “quick.” I will here remark that the three layers of the external
or hair-skin are represented in the foot; however, the epidermis is
in an entirely different form,—namely, the horny box or hoof. The
internal layer or subcutaneous tissue of the hair-skin is absent in
those parts of the foot where the pododerm covers the os pedis. There
remains, therefore, only the middle layer, derm, or <i>pododerm, which
secretes the hoof</i>, and which is the prolongation and representative
of the middle layer of the hair-skin. The pododerm is distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
from the derm of the hair-skin chiefly by the absence of hairs, oil-
and sweat-glands, and the presence on its outer surface of fleshy,
sensitive laminæ and small thread-like projections called villi.</p>

<p>The pododerm consists of five different parts: the <i>perioplic
band</i>, the <i>coronary band</i>, the <i>sensitive laminæ</i>
(podophyllous tissue), the <i>velvety tissue of the sole</i>, and the
<i>velvety tissue of the fleshy frog</i>.</p>

<p id="I_F_B_1">1. The <i>perioplic band</i> (<a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28, <i>b</i></a>)
is a narrow ridge, about one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch wide, lying between the
hair-skin and the coronary band. Somewhat broader at the toe than on
the sides, it broadens out near the bulbs of the heels, over which it
passes to end in the velvety tissue of the fleshy frog. It is separated
from the coronary band by a narrow depression called the <i>coronary
furrow</i> (Moeller). The surface of the perioplic band glistens
faintly, and is thickly studded with numerous thread-like projections
called villi, which are from one-twenty-fourth to one-twelfth of an
inch in length. <b>The perioplic band secretes the soft horn of the
perioplic ring and the perioplic or varnish-like outer layer of the wall.</b></p>

<p id="I_F_B_2">2. The <i>coronary band</i> (<a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27, <i>c</i></a>)
lies between the perioplic band and the sensitive laminæ or fleshy leaves. It presents
a prominent convex band or cushion about three-fourths of an inch wide,
which extends entirely around the foot from one bulb of the heel to the
other. In front it directly covers the anterior extensor tendon of the
toe, and at the sides the lateral surfaces of the os coronæ and the
upper part of the lateral cartilages, while farther back towards the
heels the lateral cartilages project considerably above both coronary
and perioplic bands. The coronary band is more convex (rounded) in
front than on the sides of the foot, and is flattened in the region
of the bulbs of the heels. Its surface is thickly covered with villi,
which are longer and stronger than those of the perioplic band. At the
bulbs of the heels the coronary band turns forward and inward along the
fleshy frog nearly to its summit. This portion of the coronary band is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
from one-third to one-half an inch wide, and is called the <i>bar
portion of the coronary band</i>. It is also covered with villi, which
are directly continuous with those of the fleshy frog. <b>The coronary
band secretes the principal part (middle layer) of the horny wall of
the hoof, including the bar portion (bars) of the wall.</b></p>

(<a href="#FIG_27">Figs. 27</a>, <a href="#FIG_28">28, <i>d</i></a>,
and <a href="#FIG_29">29, <i>a</i></a>), is all that portion of the pododerm
on which there are fleshy leaves. This leafy tissue covers the anterior
surface of the os pedis and the lower portion of the external surface
of the lateral cartilages. At the bulbs of the heels it turns inward at
a sharp angle and extends forward and inward, between the bar portion
of the coronary band and the posterior part of the velvety tissue of
the sole, nearly to the middle of the solar surface of the foot, to
form the <i>laminæ of the bars</i> (<a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29, <i>a</i></a>).
The fleshy wall and fleshy bars are not covered with villi, but with numerous
prominent, parallel, <i>fleshy leaves</i> placed close together, each
of which runs in a straight line downward and forward from the coronary
band to the lower border of the os pedis. Between the fleshy leaves are
deep furrows in which, in a foot which has not been deprived of its
horny capsule, lie the horny or insensitive leaves of the wall. The
fleshy leaves (podophyllous laminæ) are related to one another somewhat
as the leaves of a book; their posterior borders are attached to the
body or basement membrane of the fleshy wall, while their anterior
borders and sides are free. At their upper ends immediately below the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
coronary band the leaves are quite narrow, but they gradually increase
in width down to the middle, and thereafter maintain that breadth to
the lower border of the os pedis, where they terminate in free, fleshy
villi, which differ in no respect from those of the fleshy sole. The
number and length of the fleshy leaves vary; in a medium-sized foot
there are about five hundred, while in a large foot there may be as
many as six hundred. On the anterior surface of the os pedis the leaves
are thickest and longest; on the sides and quarters they gradually
decrease in length, while in the bar region they are the shortest and
gradually disappear near the anterior ends of the bars. The width of
the leaves decreases as they become shorter. Viewed with the naked eye
the leaves appear flat and smooth, but under the microscope one can see
on both sides of a fleshy leaf numerous small, fleshy leaflets parallel
to one another and extending lengthwise with the larger leaf. The large
ones are called <i>principal leaves</i>, and the small ones are known
as <i>collateral leaves</i>, or simply as <i>leaflets</i>.</p>

with villi, which are especially long and strong<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
near its periphery. <b>The fleshy sole</b> covers the solar plexus, or

<p id="I_F_C">(<i>c</i>) <b>The horn capsule</b> or <b>hoof</b> (<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>)
is the entire mass made up of the horn-cells secreted from the whole surface
of the pododerm, and next to the shoe is the organ with which the
horseshoer has most to do. The horn capsule or hoof is nothing more
than a very thick epidermis that protects the horse’s foot, just as
a well-fitting shoe protects the human foot. The hoof of a sound
foot is so firmly united with the underlying pododerm that only an
extraordinary force can separate them. In its normal condition the
hoof exactly fits the soft structures within it; hence it is evident
that local or general contraction of the hoof must produce pressure
on the blood-vessels and nerve-endings of the pododerm, disturb the
circulation of the blood and the nutrition of the foot, and cause pain.

<p id="I_F_C_1">The hoof is divided into three principal parts, which are solidly
united in the healthy foot,—namely, the <b>wall</b>, the <b>sole</b>,
and the <b>frog</b>. That part of the hoof which is almost wholly
visible when the foot is on the ground (<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i></a>),
and which protects the foot in front and upon the sides, is known as
the <b>wall</b>. In position, course, direction, and arrangement of
its parts it simulates the different parts of the pododerm from which
it is developed. It extends from the edge of the hair just above the
coronary band to the ground; backward it gradually decreases in height
(length), passes around the bulbs of the heels, and turns forward and
inward (<a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i></a>, and
<a href="#FIG_34">34, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i></a>) to
form the <b>bars</b>, which are finally lost in the edge of the sole
near the summit of the frog. It thus forms at each heel an angle
(<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31, <i>d</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_32">32, <i>d</i></a>)
known as a buttress, which encloses a branch of the horny sole.
Externally the wall is smooth, covered with the varnish-like periople,
and presents indistinct ring-like markings (<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>).
Its inner surface, on the contrary, presents a great number of horn-leaves
which are spoken of collectively as the <i>keraphyllous tissue</i>
(<a href="#FIG_32">Figs. 32, <i>g</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_35">35, <i>f</i></a>).
The upper or <b>coronary border</b> of the wall is thin and flexible, and on its
inner aspect is the <b>coronary groove</b>, into which fits the <b>coronary
band</b> (<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30, <i>f</i></a>). The lower border of the wall,
called the “<b>bearing-edge</b>” or <i>plantar border</i> (<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31, <i>a</i></a>),
is the one to which the horseshoe is fastened. By dividing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
hoof from before to behind along its median line, <i>outer</i> and
<i>inner</i> halves or <i>walls</i> are produced, and by dividing
the entire lower circumference of the wall into five equal parts
or sections, a <b>toe</b>, two <b>side walls or mammæ</b>, and two
<b>quarters</b> will be exhibited (<a href="#FIG_32">Figs. 32</a>
and <a href="#FIG_33">33</a>). In order to designate these regions of
the hoof still more accurately, they are spoken of as outer and inner
toes, quarters, and heels.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The direction</i> (slant) <i>and length of the wall</i> vary in one
and the same hoof, as well as between fore and hind hoofs. The portion
of the wall of fore-hoofs is the most slanting,—that is, forms the
most acute angle with the surface of the ground,—and is also the
longest. Towards the quarters the wall gradually becomes very nearly
vertical; in almost all hoofs the posterior part of the quarters slants
downward and inward towards the median vertical antero-posterior plane
of the foot. At the same time the wall, in passing back from the toe to
the heel, becomes gradually shorter in such a manner that the heights
of the toe, side walls, and quarters are related to one another about
as 3: 2: 1 in front hoofs and as 4: 3: 2 in hind hoofs. The outer
wall is, as a rule, somewhat more slanting than the inner. Viewing a
foot in profile, the toe and heel should be parallel; that is, the line
from the hair to the ground at the toe should be parallel to the line
from the hair to the ground at the buttress. <b>All deviations of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>

<p>The <i>thickness of the wall</i> is also variable. In front hoofs the
wall is thickest at the toe, and becomes gradually thinner towards
the quarters, while in hind hoofs, there is very little difference
in the thickness of the wall of the toe, sides, and quarters. <i>The
more slanting half of the hoof is always the thicker</i>; thus, for
example, the outer wall of a base-wide foot is always longer and more
oblique than the inner wall, and is also thicker. According to Mayer,
the thickness of the wall at the toe varies from three- to five-eighths
of an inch, and at the quarters from two to three-eighths of an inch.
These measurements are dependent upon the size and breeding of the horse.

     trough-like depression of the upper surface of the frog
     into <i>m</i>, the two upper channels of the frog.</p>
</div>

<p>The horn wall is composed of <i>three superposed layers</i>. These
from without to within are: (1) the <b>periople</b>, secreted by the
perioplic band. It is very thin, glistening, and varnish-like in
appearance, and covers the entire outer surface of the wall, except
where it has been removed by the rasp, and prevents rapid evaporation
of moisture from the horn. (2) The middle or <b>protective layer</b>
(<a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35, <i>d</i></a>) is the thickest, strongest, and most
important of the three layers; it forms the principal mass of the wall, and
is developed or secreted by the coronary band, which fits into the
coronary groove. There are in the coronary groove a great number of
small, funnel-shaped openings into which project the horn-producing
villi or papillæ of the coronary band. (3) The <b>inner layer</b> or
<b>keraphyllous layer</b> (<a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35, <i>f</i></a>) consists of
prominent, parallel horn-leaves lying side by side over the entire inner surface
of the middle layer of the wall, and continuing beyond the buttresses
to the ends of the bars (<a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35, <i>f′</i></a>). This layer of
horn-leaves (keraphyllous layer) has in a general way about the same shape and
arrangement as the layer of fleshy leaves (podophyllous layer) which
secretes it; for the horn-leaves fit in with the fleshy leaves in such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
a way that every fleshy leaf is embraced by two horn-leaves, and every
horn-leaf by two fleshy leaves (<a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>). The keraphyllous
layer and the horn of the inmost part of the middle or protective layer are
always white, even in pigmented (colored) hoofs.</p>

and <a href="#FIG_35">Fig. 35, <i>g</i></a>) is secreted by the velvety
tissue of the sole. A sole from which the loose flakes of old horn
have been removed is about as thick as the wall. It covers the under
surface of the foot, and presents upon its upper surface a convexity
which exactly fits into the concavity on the under surface of the os
pedis. This upper surface is thickly covered by a multitude of minute
funnel-shaped openings for the reception of the villi of the velvety
tissue of the sole (<a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>). The lower surface
of the sole is more or less concave, rough, uneven, and often covered
by loose scales of dead horn. Behind, the sole presents a triangular
opening whose borders lie partly in contact with the horny frog and
partly with the bars. This opening or re-entering angle divides
the sole into a <i>body</i> (<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31, <i>f</i></a>)
and two wings or <i>branches</i> (<a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31, <i>f′</i></a>).
The outer border of the sole unites through the medium of the <b>white
line</b> with the lower part of the inner surface of the wall,—that
is, with the keraphyllous layer of the wall. This <b>white line</b>
(<a href="#FIG_31">Figs. 31, <i>g</i></a>, and <a href="#FIG_35">35, <i>h</i></a>),
of so much importance to the horseshoer, is formed by the horn-leaves,
and by those short plugs of tubular horn which are secreted by the
villi that are always found at the lower ends of the fleshy leaves.
The white line may be said to exist wherever the horn-leaves can be
discerned upon the plantar surface of the hoof. It not only passes
around the circumference of the sole from heel to heel, but may be
followed forward from the buttresses along the bars almost to the
summit of the frog. The horn of the white line is soft, unpigmented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
(white), and possesses so very little resistance (strength) that it is often
found crumbling or even absent in places. The visible part of the white line
is usually of a grayish-black color, owing to the working in from below
of dirt and liquid manure, and to staining by rust from the nails.
<b>The white line is very important, since it serves as the point from
which we judge of the thickness of the wall, and because the horseshoe
nail should penetrate it.</b></p>

the bars and between the edges of the sole just in front of the bars,

the frog, sole, bars, and bearing-edge of the wall are on a level; that
is, the plantar surface of such hoofs is perfectly flat.</p>

<p id="I_F_C_5">The <i>minute structure of the horn</i> can scarcely be considered in
detail in an elementary treatise such as this is. However, a few of the
most important facts are as follows:</p>

<p>If we carefully examine a transverse section of the horn of the wall
(<a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>), sole, or frog, we will see with the naked eye,
though much better with a magnifying glass, many minute points quite close to
one another, and greatly resembling the small openings which we have seen
in the coronary groove of the wall and on the upper surface of the
horny sole and frog. If, now, we examine a longitudinal section of the
wall (<a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>) or sole, we will see a number of fine, dark
stripes which are straight, parallel, quite close to one another, of different
widths, and which are separated by bands of lighter horn also of
different widths. A thin section or slice of the wall taken at right
angles to the direction of these dark lines (<a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>) shows
us that the minute points that are visible to the naked eye, when held up to
the light or moderately magnified, prove to be small openings (<a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41, <i>a</i></a>).
Since these openings, shown in <a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>, represent the
dark lines shown in <a href="#FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>, because an opening is found wherever
there is a dark line, <i>we must regard all dark lines seen in longitudinal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
sections of wall, sole, and frog as hollow cylinders or tubes</i>,
though they are not always hollow, but are often filled with loosely
adjusted, crumbling, broken down horn-cells. The dark edges of the
openings (<i>a</i>) consist of thick layers of horn-cells (tube-walls).
The entire structure is called a <b>horn-tube</b>, and the
lighter-colored masses of horn (<a href="#FIG_41">Fig. 41, <i>b</i></a>)
between the tubes are known as <b>intertubular horn</b>.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>With the exception of the horny leaves of the
wall and bars, all the horn of the hoof is composed of horn-tubes and
intertubular horn.</b></p>

<p id="I_F_C_6">The horn-tubes of the wall, sole, and frog always run downward and
forward parallel to the direction of the wall at the toe,—that is,
in a direction parallel with the inclination of the hoof as a whole.
Although the wall, sole, and frog differ from one another considerably
with respect to the size and number of the horn-tubes, the quality
of the intertubular horn, and the thickness and strength of the
horn-cells, these differences are only of subordinate interest or
importance to the horseshoer; but he who desires to learn more of this
matter is referred to the work of Leisering &amp; Hartmann, “Der Fuss des
Pferdes in Rücksicht auf Bau, Verrichtungen und Hufbeschlag,” eighth
edition, Dresden, 1893. This book also treats of the variations in the
quality of hoofs, which is very important for the practical horseshoer
to know. It, furthermore, considers the solidity and strength of the
horn of the different parts of the hoof.</p>

<p>With respect to solidity, two kinds of horn are distinguished,—namely,
<b>hard</b> and <b>soft horn</b>. The periople, the white line, and the
frog are soft horn structures; the middle layer of the wall and the
sole are hard or solid horn. The wall, however, is somewhat harder and
more tenacious than the sole, for the latter passes off in more or less
large flakes (exfoliates) or crumbles away on its lower surface, at least
in shod feet, while no such spontaneous shortening occurs in the wall.

Soft horn differs from hard horn in that its horn-cells never become
hard and horn-like. It is very elastic, absorbs water quickly, and as
readily dries out and becomes very hard and brittle and easily fissured
and chapped. With respect to <i>quality</i>, we distinguish good and
bad horn; the former is fine and tenacious (tough), the latter coarse
and either soft and crumbling or hard and brittle. If not dried out,
all horn is elastic, though soft horn is more elastic than hard. All
horn is a <i>poor conductor of heat</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above3">As there are well-formed and badly formed bodies, so
there are well-formed and badly formed limbs and hoofs. The form of the hoof
depends upon the position of the limb. A straight limb of normal
direction possesses, as a rule, a regular hoof, while an oblique or
crooked limb is accompanied by an irregular or oblique hoof. Hence,
it is necessary, before discussing the various forms of the hoof, to
consider briefly the various positions that may be assumed by the
limbs. In this discussion we shall deal with the <b>living</b> horse.</p>

<h4 id="II_A">A. Standing Positions of the Limbs.</h4>

<p>The position of a limb depends upon the varying lengths of its
component bones and the angles at which they meet one another. To judge
the standing position of a fore-limb one must stand <i>in front</i>
of the horse; to judge a hind limb, stand <i>behind</i> the horse;
the backward or forward deviations of both front and hind limbs are
judged by standing at the side. But a horse does not always move as his
standing position would lead one to suspect; standing and moving are
different. Therefore, in order to arrive at a proper judgment, one must
observe the limbs both at rest and in motion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p id="II_A_A">(<i>a</i>) <b>The position of a limb viewed from in front</b>
is normal or straight (<a href="#FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>) when it stands vertical
or perpendicular. A plumb-line dropped from the point of the shoulder (middle
of the scapulo-humeral articulation) should pass down the middle
line of the limb, dividing it into inner and outer halves of
equal width, and meeting the ground at the middle of the toe.</p>

<p>In the <i>base-wide standing position</i> (<a href="#FIG_45">Fig. 45</a>) the
plumb-line falls to the inner side of the limb; the limb extends obliquely
downward and outward. To this class belong also the <i>knee-narrow</i>
(knock-kneed) <i>position</i>, in which the knees are too close
together, while the feet stand wide apart, and the <i>toe-wide
position</i> (splay-footed, <a href="#FIG_46">Fig. 46</a>) in which
the toes point obliquely forward and outward. In base-wide positions
either the entire limb extends downward and outward or the foot alone
is turned outward.</p>

<p>The <i>base-narrow position</i> is frequently observed in horses with
very wide breasts. The limbs run downward and inward, a plumb-line
dropped from the point of the shoulder falling to the outer side of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
leg and foot. A special form of the base-narrow position is the
<i>toe-narrow</i> or <i>pigeon-toed position</i> (<a href="#FIG_47">Fig. 47</a>).
In some instances the legs are straight and perpendicular down to the fetlock,
while from there to the ground the phalanges incline obliquely inward.
Another form is the <i>knee-wide</i> or <i>bandy-legged position</i>,
in which the knees are placed too far apart, while the cannons and
phalanges incline downward and inward.</p>

tuberosity of the acromian spine (point of union of the upper and middle thirds of
the scapula or shoulder-blade) divides the leg from the elbow to the
fetlock into anterior and posterior halves of equal width, and touches
the ground immediately back of the bulbs of the heel. A perpendicular
line dropped from the point of union of the middle and lower thirds
of the scapula (shoulder-blade) will cut the humerus into halves, and
meet the ground between the toe and the heel.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The <i>foot-axis</i> (line of direction of the three phalanges) and the

the horizontal ground-surface.

dropped from the tuberosity of the ischium (<a href="#FIG_1">see Fig. 1, 9″</a>) divides
the entire limb into inner and outer halves of equal width and touches
the ground opposite the median lacuna of the frog. <b>Seen from the
side</b>, this line just touches the point of the hock and, passing
down at some distance from the flexor tendons, meets the ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
considerably back of the heels. A perpendicular line dropped from the
hip-joint should pass through the foot, meeting the ground half-way
between the point of the toe and the heel (<a href="#FIG_49">Fig. 49</a>).
There are base-wide, base-narrow, toe-wide, and toe-narrow deviations
in the hind limbs as in the fore-limbs.</p>

<p>The hind limbs are <i>base-wide</i> when they, either as a whole or in
part, deviate outward from the normal. The “<i>cow-hocked</i>“ position
(<a href="#FIG_56">Fig. 56</a>) is an example of the base-wide; in this case the
points of the hocks are too close and turn towards each other, while the feet are
widely separated and the toes turned outward. <i>Base-narrow</i> is
that position of the hind legs in which either the entire leg deviates
to the inner side of the perpendicular (<a href="#FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>), or the leg
is about perpendicular down as far as the hock, but below this joint runs
downward and inward (<a href="#FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>). In this latter case the hocks
may be too far apart, the leg is bent outward at the hock and the animal is termed
“<i>bandy-legged</i>,” “<i>bow-legged</i>.”</p>

<p><b>Viewing a hind limb from the side</b>, it may be observed to deviate
either forward or backward from the normal. Among forward deviations
is the so-called “<i>sabre-leg</i>“ or “<i>sickle-hock</i>“ (<a href="#FIG_59">Fig. 59</a>),
in which the hock-joint is too much flexed, the foot placed too far
forward under the body, and the fetlock too slanting. In the position
known as “<i>camped behind</i>” (<a href="#FIG_60">Fig. 60</a>) the leg is
behind the body and the pastern is too upright, too nearly vertical.</p>

<p>It is possible for each limb of the same horse to assume a different
direction. It more often happens that if the fore-limbs are base-wide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the hind limbs are base-narrow, or <i>vice</i> <i>versa</i>. While
there are some other deviations that differ somewhat from those already
described, they are of less importance to the horseshoer.</p>

<p>In all the various positions of the limbs we find the feet in one of
the following <i>three forms</i>, or very closely approaching one of
them. By means of a proper knowledge of these three forms, the judging
of the form, flight of the foot in travelling, and preparation of the
hoof for the shoe, as well as the choice of the length of the shoe, are
regulated, facilitated, and simplified.</p>

<p>Whether a horse’s feet be observed from <i>in front</i> or from
<i>behind</i>, their form corresponds to, or at least resembles,
either that of the <b>regular</b> position (<a href="#FIG_61">Figs. 61</a>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
A peculiar form of foot is the so-called <i>bear-foot</i> (<a href="#FIG_70">Fig. 70</a>),
in which the foot-axis, viewed from the side, is broken strongly forward
at the coronet. The wall at the toe stands much steeper than the long
pastern and is more or less convex; in other words, a low-jointed,
sloping pastern is attached to an upright hoof. Such a foot is
sometimes improperly called a “club-foot.”</p>

<h4 id="II_C">C. Lines of Flight of Hoofs in Motion.</h4>

<p>If we observe horses moving unrestrained over level ground, we will
notice differences in the carriage of the feet. <b>Viewed from in
front, or from behind</b>, in the <i>regular standing position</i> of
the limbs the hoofs are carried forward in a <i>straight direction</i>,
that is, in a line parallel with the median line of the body (<a href="#FIG_71">Fig. 71</a>).
The toes likewise point straight forward; the hoofs alight properly
(flat) on the ground. If the horse stands <i>base-wide</i>, the hoof is
carried in a circle; from its position, which is behind and well out
from the median line, the hoof passes first forward and inward until it
is close to the supporting leg, and then outward to the ground (<a href="#FIG_72">Fig. 72</a>),
where the shock is received principally upon the outer toe. The
toes point either directly forward, as in the regular standing position
(<a href="#FIG_72">Fig. 72</a>), or forward and outward as in the toe-wide position
(<a href="#FIG_73">Fig. 73</a>). In the toe-wide position the hoof in its flight
may cross the median line.</p>

<p>Exactly the reverse is true of the horse that stands
<i>base-narrow</i>; in this case the hoof is moved in a circle whose
convexity is outward,—that is, the hoof from its position behind,
and close to the median line, is carried forward and outward and then
inward to the ground (<a href="#FIG_74">Figs. 74</a> and <a href="#FIG_75">75</a>).</p>

<p>1. With a straight foot-axis of <i>normal slant</i> (45°-50°, <a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76, <i>A</i></a>),
the hoof follows the arc of a circle and reaches its highest
point when directly above the supporting hoof, <i>i.e.</i>, when
half-way in the stride.</p>

<p>2. With a straight, but <i>acute-angled</i> foot-axis (less than 45°,
<a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76, <i>B</i></a>), the hoof rises rapidly, reaches its
highest point before it has completed the first half of the stride, <i>i.e.</i>,
before it has passed the supporting hoof, and descending gradually in a
long curve alights easily on the ground.</p>

<p>3. With a straight, but upright foot-axis (55° or more, <a href="#FIG_76">Fig. 76, <i>C</i></a>),
the hoof rises slowly, reaches its highest point in front of
the supporting hoof, from which point it descends rapidly. The gait is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“choppy,” and in the saddle-horse unpleasant for the rider. <i>The
length and the height of the stride are greatest in acute-angled feet;
least in upright feet.</i> Furthermore, length and height of stride
are in a measure dependent on breeding, training, condition of the
legs (whether stiffened by use or disease), length of the hoof and the
weight of the shoe.</p>

</div>

<p>Many deviations in the line of flight of hoofs and in the manner in
which they are set to the ground occur; for example, horses heavily
burdened or pulling heavy loads, and, therefore, not having free use of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
their limbs, project their limbs irregularly and meet the ground first
with the toe; however, careful observation will detect the presence
of one or the other of these lines of flight of the foot. Irregular
carriage of the feet renders a horse unsuitable for general purposes
only when it is very pronounced, in which case certain troublesome
conditions, such as interfering and disease of joints, are of frequent
occurrence.</p>

<h4 id="II_D">D. The Influence of Weight in the Shoe<br /> or Otherwise
Attached to the Hoof,<br /> in Altering the Flight of the Hoof.</h4>

<p>There is nothing mysterious in the effect of weight upon the flight of
the feet. On the contrary, the lines of flight are determined (as shown
in pages 72-74, <a href="#FIG_71">Figs. 71-76</a>), <i>first</i>, by the relation
of the transverse axes of the hinge-joints of the leg and foot to the line of
progression (median line); <i>second</i>, by the length and obliquity
of the hoof and pastern; <i>third</i>, by the height and length of
stride which is natural to each individual.</p>

<p><i>Weight induces higher action and a longer stride.</i> Inertia
increases with the weight. A heavy shoe cannot be snatched from the
ground as quickly as a light one, but when moving forward at a given
velocity its greater momentum (momentum = mass (wt) × velocity: m = wt
× v) carries the foot farther forward then does the lighter shoe. Thus,
the heavier shoe, or weight attached to the hoof, lengthens the stride
at both ends. The farther from the centre of rotation of the scapula
the weight is placed, <i>i.e.</i>, the nearer to the toe it is placed,
the greater the muscular effort required to start it and to stop it.</p>

<p><i>Height of action</i>, though largely the result of breeding,
temperament, and the exhilaration that accompanies perfect health and
entire absence of muscular fatigue, is to a certain extent influenced
by the <i>inclination of the pastern and toe to the cannon</i>. <i>The
acute-angled foot</i>, in the folding of the leg during the first half
of the stride, moves through a longer arc of a circle whose centre is
the fetlock joint than does the normal or the upright foot; rises more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
rapidly and to a higher point. (<a href="#FIG_76">See Fig. 76, <i>B</i></a>.)
When the momentum of a foot moving rapidly and abruptly upward is increased by
weight the result is extreme and even exaggerated flexion of all joints
of the leg, and by allowing the hoof to grow long the flexion is still
further increased. In the show ring, harness horses with fair natural
action may be made to “climb” by shoes weighing from thirty to sixty
ounces upon hoofs an inch or more longer than normal. The leverage of a
heavy shoe on a long hoof is excessive, fatiguing and most injurious to
ligament, tendon and muscle. The action, while high, is <i>labored</i>,
<i>pounding</i> and <i>altogether inelegant</i>.</p>

<p>In the training of trotters weight is often used <i>to increase the
length of the stride</i>, or to cause a <i>higher folding of a front
foot</i>, in order to prevent “scalping“ or “speedy-cut.“ As soon as
the new gait becomes a fixed habit the weight should be gradually
lessened. <i>Weight is carried with less fatigue at a trot</i> then
at a pace, or at a gallop. It therefore steadies a trotter that is
inclined to pace, or “break” into a run. The increased momentum of
the weighted hoof makes for rhythm of movement, and increases the
difficulty of skipping, dwelling, or mixing gaits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>base-wide</i> (toe-wide) and <i>base-narrow</i> (toe-narrow)
<i>standing positions</i>, the flight of the hoofs, as seen from in
front or behind, is not straight forward, <i>i.e.</i>, parallel to
the line of progression of the body, but in <i>arcs of circles</i>.
(<a href="#FIG_72">See Figs. 72-75</a>, p. 73.) In these cases, increasing the
weight of the hoofs, by increasing the momentum, must of necessity increase the
tendency of the hoofs to move off at a tangent to the curves which
they describe. In other words, <i>weight increases the centrifugal
force</i> of a body moving in a curve. The <i>outward swing</i> of the
hoofs of a base-narrow horse (paddling), and the <i>inward swing</i>
of a base-wide horse (interfering), are made <i>more pronounced by
adding weight to any part of the hoof</i>. <i>The centrifugal force is
greatest</i> in base-wide feet when the weight is on the medial, or
inner side of the hoof; in base-narrow feet when it is on the lateral
or outer side.</p>

<p>A side weight, or side weight shoe is often of service in a cross
firing pacer. This animal usually stands base-narrow (toe-narrow)
behind, and in motion his hind hoofs describe a curve at first forward
and outward and then inward till contact is made with the diagonal hoof
or leg. The added weight (placed on the outer side) by increasing the
centrifugal force carries the hoof just enough farther from the centre
around which the hoof swings to prevent contact. (<a href="#Page_138">See
cross-firing, p. 138</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally, it must not be forgotten that <i>weight is always weight</i>;
that it <i>cuts speed</i> and <i>devours endurance</i>.</p>

<h4 id="II_E">E. Forms of Hoofs.</h4>

<p><i>A front hoof of the regular standing position</i> (<a href="#FIG_79">Fig. 79</a>).
The inner and outer walls differ but little in direction and thickness.
The outer wall is a little thicker and somewhat more slanting than the
inner (<a href="#FIG_61">see Figs. 61</a> and <a href="#FIG_62">62</a>),
and its outer circumference describes a larger arc of a circle,—that
is, is more curved, as can be seen both at its plantar border and at
the coronet. The length of the quarter in relation to the length or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
height of the side wall and toe is about as 1: 2: 3. The toe forms an
angle with the ground of forty-five to fifty degrees (<a href="#FIG_68">see Fig. 68</a>).
The direction of the wall at the toe, viewed from the side, should be
parallel with the direction of the long pastern.</p>

<div id="FIG_79" class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><i>A hoof of the base-wide position</i> (<a href="#FIG_80">Fig. 80</a>)
<i>is always awry</i>, because the outer wall is naturally somewhat longer
and decidedly more slanting then the inner (<a href="#FIG_63">see Figs. 63</a>
and <a href="#FIG_64">64</a>). The plantar border of the outer wall
describes a large arc, whose sharpest curvature is where the side
wall passes into the quarter. The plantar border of the inner wall is
straighter (less curved); the outer half of the ground-surface (sole)
of the hoof is, therefore, wider than the inner. So long as the hoof
is healthy, both branches of the frog are equally developed. The
wryness of the hoof depends upon the direction of the limb; therefore,
a base-wide hoof should be regarded as a <i>normally wry hoof</i>, to
distinguish it from hoofs which are wry from disease.</p>

<p><i>A hoof of the toe-wide position</i> (<a href="#FIG_81">Fig. 81</a>)
is distinguished from the preceding by the bending or curvature of the
plantar border of the outer toe and inner quarter being often decidedly
less pronounced than on the inner toe and outer quarter; therefore,
two short curves and two long curves lie opposite each other; in other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
words, the inner toe and outer quarter, lying opposite each other, are
sharply curved, while the outer toe and inner quarter, lying opposite
each other, are much less sharply bent or curved. The toes are turned
out. The feet are not set down flat upon the ground, but meet it with
the outer toe.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p><i>A hoof of the base-narrow position is normally wry</i>, but never
so pronounced as a hoof of the base-wide position. The inner wall is
but little, more oblique than the outer, the difference being most
noticeable at the quarters (<a href="#FIG_65">Figs. 65</a> and
<a href="#FIG_66">66</a>). The curve of the plantar border of the wall
is similar to that of a regular hoof, except that the inner side wall
and quarter are a little more sharply curved in a base-narrow hoof.
Occasionally the outer quarter is somewhat drawn in under the foot.</p>

<p>This form of hoof is most distinctly marked in animals that stand
toe-narrow or are bandy-legged.</p>

<p>As to the <i>forms of the hind hoofs</i>, what has been said concerning
the influence of position of the limbs upon the shape of the front feet
will apply equally well to them. The hind hoof (<a href="#FIG_82">Fig. 82</a>)
is not round at the toe, but somewhat pointed or oval. It greatest width is
between the middle and posterior thirds of the sole. It usually has a strongly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
concave sole and a somewhat steeper toe than the fore-hoof; viewed from
the side, the angle of the toe with the ground in the regular standing
position is from fifty to fifty-five degrees.</p>

<div id="FIG_82" class="figcenter">

     cleft of frog.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, we also distinguish <i>wide</i> and <i>narrow</i> hoofs; they
are not dependent upon the position of the limbs, but upon the race and
breeding of the animal.</p>

<p><i>The wide hoof</i> (<a href="#FIG_83">Fig. 83</a>) is almost round upon
its plantar surface. Its wall runs quite oblique to the ground. The sole is but
moderately concave, and the frog is strong and well developed. <i>The
narrow hoof</i> (<a href="#FIG_84">Fig. 84</a>) is rather elliptical,
with steep side walls, strongly concaved sole, and small, undeveloped
frog. The horn of the narrow hoof is fine and tough; of the wide hoof,
usually coarse. The wide hoof may readily become flat. Narrow hoofs are
either the result of breeding or premature shoeing.</p>

<p>In enumerating the preceding forms of the hoof we have by no means
referred to all the forms in which the hoof may be found; on the
contrary, hoofs vary in shape and quality to such an extent that among
a hundred horses no two hoofs can be found which are exactly alike. In
fact, the same variety exists as in the faces of people, and we know
that we can recall in succession even many more faces without finding
two that are exactly alike. This explains the manifold differences in
horse’s shoes with respect to size, form and other qualities.

<p>Suppose now a hoof is before us; it is first necessary to know whether
or not it is <b>healthy</b>. Unfortunately, a perfectly healthy hoof
is not so easy to find as one may think. We recognize a sound hoof by
the following marks: Seen from in front or from the side, the course
of the wall from the coronet to the ground, in the direction of the
horn-tubes, is straight,—that is, bent neither in nor out. A straight
edge, placed upon the wall in the direction of the horn-tubes, touches
at every point. The wall must show neither longitudinal nor transverse
cracks or fissures. If there be rings, their position and course are
important. Rings which pass around the entire circumference of the
wall parallel to the coronet indicate nothing more than disturbances
of nutrition of the hoof; <i>but the hoof cannot pass for sound</i>
when the rings have any other position and direction than the one
mentioned, or if the rings upon any part of the wall are more marked
than elsewhere, even though they may be parallel to the coronary band.
Marked ring-building upon the hoofs of horses which have regular
feeding, grooming, and work indicates a weak hoof. Viewed from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
ground-surface and from behind, the bulbs of the heels should be well
rounded, strongly developed, and not displaced. The concave sole should
show no separation along the white line. The frog should be strong,
well developed, and have symmetrical branches and a broad, shallow, dry
median lacuna. The lateral lacunæ of the frog should be clean and not
too narrow. The bars should pass in a straight direction forward and
inward towards the point of the frog. Any bending outward of the bars
towards the branches of the sole indicates the beginning of a narrowing
of the space occupied by the frog,—that is, contraction of the heels.
The horn of the branches of the sole in the buttresses and in their
proximity should show no red staining. The lateral cartilages should be
elastic. No part of the foot should be weakened at the cost of other
parts. By firm union of all strong parts the strength and vigor of the
hoof is in no sense disturbed. <i>If one desires to ascertain the exact
form and state of health of the hoof, it must never be inspected and
judged alone, but in connection with the entire limb.</i></p>

<h4 id="II_F">F. Growth of the Hoof and Wear<br /> of the Hoof and Shoe.</h4>

<p>All parts of the horn of the hoof grow downward and forward, the
material for this growth being furnished by the remarkably large
quantity of blood which flows to the pododerm. The growth of the hoof
is regulated by the nerves.</p>

<p>As a rule, the hoof grows <b>uniformly</b>,—that is, one section of
the wall grows just as rapidly as another. A visible indication of growth
is the increase in height and width of the hoof from colthood to maturity.</p>

<p>The <i>rapidity of growth</i> of the wall varies, amounting in a month
to from one-sixth to one-half of an inch. The average monthly growth
in both shod and unshod horses of both sexes is, according to my own
experiments, one-third of an inch. Hind hoofs grow faster than front
hoofs, and unshod faster than shod. The hoofs of stallions grow more
slowly than those of mares and geldings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Abundant <b>exercise</b>, proper grooming (flexibility and moistness
of the horn), regular dressing of the wall, and <b>running barefoot</b>
from time to time <b>favor growth</b>; while little or no exercise,
dryness, and excessive length of the hoof hinder growth.</p>

<p>The time required for the horn to grow from the coronet to the ground
is, therefore, equally variable, and is, moreover, dependent upon the
height (length of toe) of the hoof. At the toe the horn grows down in
from eleven to thirteen months, at the mammæ or sides in from six to
eight months, and at the quarters in from three to five months. The
time required for the renewal of the entire hoof we term the <i>period
of hoof renewal</i>. If, for example, we know exactly the rapidity
of horn growth in a given case, we can estimate without difficulty
the length of the “period of hoof renewal,” as well for the entire
hoof as for each individual section of the wall. The duration of many
diseases of the hoof (cracks, clefts, partial bendings of the wall,
contractions, etc.) can be foretold with relative certainty only by
knowing the period of hoof renewal.</p>

<p><i>Irregular growth</i> sometimes takes place. The chief cause of
this is usually an improper distribution of the body-weight over the
hoof,—that is, an unbalanced foot. Wry hoofs of faulty positions of
the limbs are often exposed to this evil; a faulty preparation of the
hoof (dressing) for the shoe, as well as neglect of the colt’s hoofs,
is in the majority of cases directly responsible for this condition.</p>

<p>If in the shortening of the wall a part is from ignorance left too
long, or one-half of the hoof shortened too much in relation to the
other half, the foot will be unbalanced. The horse will then touch the
ground first with the section of wall which has been left too high, and
will continue to do so until this long section has been reduced to its
proper level (length) by the increased wear which will take place at
this point. In unshod hoofs this levelling process takes place rapidly;
such, however, is not the case in shod hoofs, for here the shoe prevents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
rapid wear, and, indeed this levelling process is often rendered
impossible through the welding of high steel calks to the shoe. If this
fault in trimming be repeated at the next and subsequent shoeings,
and if the faulty relation of the ground-surface of the hoof to the
direction of the foot-axis remain during several months, the portion of
wall left too high will grow more rapidly, the walls will lose their
natural straight direction and become bent. If, for example, the outer
wall has been left too long during a considerable period of time, a
crooked hoof results (<a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>) in which the rings are placed
closer together upon the low (concave) side than upon the high (convex) side.
If for a long time the toe is excessively long, it will become bent;
or if this fault affects excessively high quarters they will contract
either just under the coronary band or will curl forward and inward at
their lower borders. These examples are sufficient to show both the
importance of the manner in which a horse places his foot to the ground
and its influence upon the loading, growth, and form of the hoof.</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><b>Wear of the Shoe and of<br />
the Hoof upon the Shoe.</b></p>

<p>The wear of the shoe is caused much less by the weight of the animal’s
body than by the rubbing which takes place between the shoe and the
earth whenever the foot is placed to the ground and lifted.</p>

<p>The wear of the shoe which occurs when the foot is placed on the ground
is termed “<b>grounding wear</b>,” and that which occurs while the foot
is being lifted from the ground is termed “<b>swinging-off wear</b>.“
When a horse travels normally, both kinds of wear are nearly alike, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
are very distinct when the paces are abnormal, especially when there is
faulty direction of the limbs. While in the majority of horses whose
limbs have been stiffened by age and overwork both kinds of wear are
most marked at the toe of the shoe, we see relatively fewer cases of
“grounding wear” at the ends of the branches (as in laminitis); on the
contrary, we <b>always</b> notice “swinging-off wear” at the toe of the
shoe. It is worthy of notice that length of stride has much to do with
the wear. We observe that with shortening of the stride both kinds of
wear occur at the toe of the shoe, and this is rapidly worn away, as
is the case with horses which are fretful and prance under the rider,
draw heavy loads, or from any other cause, as disease or infirmity, are
obliged to shorten their steps. With increase of length of stride the
wear of the shoe becomes more uniform.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>The <i>position</i> and <i>form of the shoe</i> have a marked influence
upon its wear; <b>at the place where the shoe is too far under the
hoof</b> either as a result of shifting or of having been nailed on
crooked, or where the outer branch has not the necessary width, or does
not form a sufficiently large curve, <b>the wear will be increased</b>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Also the relative length of side walls, or of toe and heels, influences
rapidity of wear of the shoe. If through ignorance or carelessness one
side wall be left too long, the branch beneath will meet the ground before
other parts of the shoe and will wear faster (<a href="#FIG_87">see Figs. 87</a>,
<a href="#FIG_88">88</a> and <a href="#FIG_89">89</a>).</p>

<p><i>The wear of the hoof upon the shoe</i> occurs as a result of the
movements of the quarters. Visible indications of this are the brightly
polished, often sunken places upon the bearing-surface of the ends
of the branches, showing that scouring occurs between the horn and
the iron. Shoes which show brightly polished places in their anterior
halves have been loose. The wear of the quarters upon the shoe is not
always uniform, but is usually greater on the inner than on the outer
quarter, especially in base-wide feet. The degree of this wear of the
hoof may be from nothing to one-fourth of an inch or more from one
shoeing to the next. Finally, we should remember that this usually
invisible scouring away of the hoof gradually causes the nails at the
quarters to become loose, and that this is more clearly marked in the
front than in the hind hoofs.</p>

<h4 id="II_G">G. Physiological Movements of the Hoof.<br />
(Mechanism of the Hoof.)</h4>

<p>These movements comprise all those changes of position within and of
the hoof which are brought about by alternately weighting and relieving
the foot, and which are manifest as changes of form of the hoof. The
following changes in form of the hoof are most marked at the time that
the hoof bears greatest weight,—that is, <i>simultaneous</i> with the
greatest descent of the fetlock-joint.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. A lateral expansion over the entire region of the quarters,
occurring simultaneously at the coronary and plantar borders. This
expansion is small, and in general varies between one-fiftieth and
one-twelfth of an inch.</p>

<p>2. A narrowing of the anterior half of the hoof measured at the
coronary border.</p>

<p>3. A decrease in height of the hoof, with a slight sinking of the
heels.</p>

<p>4. A flattening (sinking) of the sole, especially in its
branches.</p>
</div>

<p>These changes of form are much more pronounced in the half of the hoof
that bears the greater weight.</p>

<div id="FIG_89" class="figcenter">

     the middle of a right fore shod hoof of base-wide

     insufficiently lowered has caused increased wear of the
     underlying branch of the shoe: <i>a</i>, wear of inner
     branch (beneath the relatively short wall); <i>b</i>,
     greater wear of outer branch beneath the relatively long
     wall; <i>c</i>, the horn between the dotted line and the
     shoe represents the surplus length of this outer wall.</p>
</div>

<p>A hoof while supporting the body-weight has a different form, and
the tissues enclosed within it a different position, than when not
bearing weight. Since loading and unloading of the foot are continually
alternating, the relations of internal pressure even in the standing
animal are continuously changing, so that, strictly speaking, the hoof
is never at rest.</p>

<p>The changes in form take place in the following order: the body-weight
falls from above upon the os coronæ, os pedis, and navicular bone, and
at the moment that the foot is placed upon the ground is transmitted
through the sensitive laminæ and horny laminæ to the wall. At the
instant that the fetlock reaches its lowest point the os pedis bears
the greatest weight. Under the body-weight the latter yields, and with
the navicular bone sinks downward and backward. At the same time the
upper posterior portion of the os coronæ (<a href="#FIG_90">Fig. 90, <i>A</i></a>)
passes backward and downward between the lateral cartilages (<i>a</i>), which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
project above the upper border of the wall, and presses the perforans
tendon down upon the plantar cushion. The plantar cushion being
compressed from above, and being unable to expand downward, is
correspondingly squeezed out towards the sides and crowded against the
lateral cartilages, and they, yielding, press against and push before
them the wall at the quarters. The resistance of the earth acts upon
the plantar surface of the hoof, and especially upon the frog, and
it, widening, crowds the bars apart, and in this manner contributes
to the expansion of the quarters, especially at their plantar border
(<a href="#FIG_90">see Fig. 90</a>). The horny sole under the descent
and pressure of the os pedis sinks a little—that is, the arch of the
sole becomes somewhat flattened. All these changes are much more marked
upon <i>sound unshod</i> hoofs, because in them the resistance of the
earth upon the sole and frog is pronounced and complete. These changes
in form are more marked in front feet than in hind. In defective
and diseased hoofs it may happen that at the moment of greatest
weight-bearing, instead of an expansion a contraction may occur at the
plantar border of the quarters.</p>

<div id="FIG_90" class="figcenter">

     ligament of the navicular bone; <i>l</i>, wall; <i>m</i>,
     sole; <i>n</i>, white line; <i>o</i>, frog.</p>
</div>

<p>Three highly elastic organs there are which play the chief part in
these movements,—namely, the lateral cartilages, the plantar cushion,
and the horny frog. Besides these structures, indeed, all the remaining
parts of the horn capsule, especially its coronary border, possess more
or less elasticity, and contribute to the above-mentioned changes of form.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the elastic tissues of the foot in their proper
activity, regular and <i>abundant exercise</i>, with protection against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
drying out of the hoof, are absolutely necessary, because the movements
of the different structures within the foot and the changes of form
that occur at each step are indispensable in preserving the health of
the hoof. Long-continued rest in the stable, drying out of the hoof,
and shoeing decrease or alter the physiological movements of the foot,
and these lead under certain conditions to foot diseases, with which
the majority of horse owners are entirely unacquainted.</p>

<p>As an outward, visible indication of the mobility of the quarters upon
the shoe we may point to the conspicuous, brightly polished, and often
sunken spots, or grooves, upon the ends of the branches. They are
produced partly by an in-and-out motion of the walls at the quarters,
and partly by a forward and backward gliding of the quarters upon the shoe.</p>

<p><i>The benefits of these physiological movements</i> within the hoof
are manifold:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Through them shock is dispersed and the body protected from the
evil consequences of concussion or shock.</p>

<p>2. These movements increase the elasticity of the entire limb, and
in this way contribute much to a light and elegant gait.</p>

<p>3. They maintain a lively circulation of blood in the vessels of the
pododerm, and this insures a rapid growth of horn.</p>
</div>

<p>Since it is a generally accepted fact that shoeing interferes with
the physiological movements of the hoof, alters them, indeed, almost
suppresses them, and that all these movements are spontaneous
and natural only in sound <i>unshod</i> hoofs, we are justified
in regarding shoeing as a <i>necessary evil</i>. However, it is
indispensable if we wish to render horses serviceable upon hard
artificial roads. If, in shoeing, consideration be given to the
structure and functions of the hoof, and particularly to the
hoof-surface of the shoe, the ends of the branches being provided with
a smooth, level bearing-surface, which allows free play to the elastic
horn capsule, in so far as this is not hindered by the nails we need
have no fear of subsequent disease of the hoofs, provided the horse is
used with reason and receives proper care.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="III_A">A. Examination of a Horse Preliminary to Shoeing.</h4>

<p>An examination should be made while the animal is <b>at rest</b>, and
afterwards while <b>in motion</b>. The object of the examination is to
gain accurate knowledge of the direction and movements of the limbs, of
the form and character of the feet and hoofs, of the manner in which
the foot reaches and leaves the ground, of the form, length, position,
and wear of the shoe, and distribution of the nail-holes, in order
that at the next and subsequent shoeings all ascertained peculiarities
of hoof-form may be kept in mind and all discovered faults of shoeing
corrected.</p>

<p>The examination is best conducted in the following order: The horse
should first be led at a walk in a straight line from the observer over
as level a surface as possible, then turned about and brought back,
that the examiner may notice the direction of the limbs and the manner
in which the hoofs are moved and set to the ground. While the animal
is moving away the observer notices particularly the hind limbs, and
as it comes towards him he examines the fore-limbs. Then a few steps
at a trot will not only show whether or not the animal is lame, but
will often remove all doubt in those cases in which, while the animal
was walking, the examiner was unable to make up his mind as to which
was the predominating position of the limb. The problem presented is,
therefore, to determine whether or not the direction of the limbs, the
lines of flight of the hoofs, and the manner in which they are set down
and picked up are regular. If there are deviations from the normal they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
will fall either into the base-wide and toe-wide group or into the
base-narrow and toe-narrow group. When clear upon these points the
horse is allowed to stand quietly, and the observer, placing himself
in front, examines the foot more closely, fixes the direction of the
foot-axis clearly in his mind, marks also the form and character of
the hoofs and the position of the coronets, as far as these parts
can be inspected from in front. At the same time each hoof should be
closely inspected to determine whether the slant of both quarters
corresponds to the direction of the long pastern, and whether the
course of the wall from the coronet to the plantar border is straight
or bent in or out (contraction, fulness). Walls curved from above to
below always indicate an unnatural height of some section of the wall
and a displacement of the base of support of the foot. In order to
gain accurate and complete knowledge of the position of the limbs,
the flight of the hoofs, and the manner of setting the foot to the
ground, the horse must frequently be moved back and forth many times,
especially when the standing position is somewhat irregular and the
hoofs are of different shapes.</p>

<p>At this point begins the examination of the position of the limbs, and
the form of the feet and hoofs, in profile. After casting a glance over
the entire body, so as to gain an idea of the animal’s weight, height,
and length, the attention is turned to the position and direction of
the limbs and hoofs. The eye should particularly note whether the form
of the hoof corresponds to the position of the limb, and, furthermore,
whether the slant of the pastern is the same as that of the wall at
the toe,—that is, whether the foot-axis is straight or broken; also
whether the toes and quarters are parallel, for the toe is sometimes
bulging (convex) or hollowed out (concave) between the coronet and
plantar border, and the quarters are frequently contracted and drawn or
shoved under the foot (weak quarters). If the wall present rings the
observer should note their position with reference to one another and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
to the coronet, and also their extent, and, furthermore, should
determine whether or not they cross one another (thrush of the frog).
At the same time he should notice the length of the shoes.</p>

<p>Next, the feet should be raised and the examiner should notice the
width of the hoof, the arching of the sole, the character of the frog,
the position of the bulbs of the heel, as well as the presence of any
cracks or clefts in the wall. Then the old shoes should be examined as
to their age, form, the distribution and direction of their nail-holes
(“punching”), position, and wear. With respect to the form of the
old shoe, one should observe whether or not it corresponds to the
form of the hoof. The same careful examination should be made of the
number and distribution of the nail-holes. As regards the position
of the shoe, one must first ascertain whether it completely covers
the bearing-surface of the wall, and whether the shoe extends beyond
the wall at any point and has caused interfering or given rise to
irregular wear. Finally, the wear of the shoe should be observed, and
the following points borne in mind: <i>One-sided wear, uneven setting
down of the feet, and an unnatural course of the wall are often found
together</i>, especially when uneven wearing of the shoe has existed
for a long time,—that is, during several shoeings. As a rule, in such
a case the more worn branch of the shoe is too near the centre of the
foot, and the opposite branch too far from the centre (too “full”); in
other words, the base of support (shoe) has been shifted too far in the
direction of the less worn branch. Moreover, increased wear of a part
of a shoe is an indication that the section of the wall above it is too
high (too long) (<a href="#FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>), or that the wall upon
the opposite side of the foot is too low (short). The twisting movement
of many hind feet should, from physiological reasons, not be hindered
by shoeing.</p>

<h4 id="III_B">B. Raising and Holding the Feet<br />
of the Horse to be Shod.</h4>

<p>This can always be done without much trouble if the horse has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
accustomed to it from early colthood. Certain rules governing the
manner of taking hold of the feet, and of afterwards manipulating them,
are of value.</p>

<p>A shoer should <b>never grasp a foot suddenly</b>, or with both hands.
The horse should first be prepared for this act. First see that the
horse stands in such a position that he can bear his weight comfortably
upon three legs. This is well worth noticing, and if the horse does not
voluntarily assume such an easy position, move him gently until his
feet are well under his body.</p>

<p>If the shoer, for example, wishes to raise the left fore foot for
inspection, he stands on the left side facing the animal, speaks
quietly to him, places the palm of the right hand flat upon the
animal’s shoulder, and, at the same time, with the left hand strokes
the limb downward to the cannon and seizes the cannon <i>from in
front</i>. With the right hand he now gently presses the horse towards
the opposite side, and the foot becoming loose as the weight is shifted
upon the other leg, he lifts it from the ground. The right hand now
grasps the pastern from the inside followed by the left hand upon the
inside and the right hand on the outside; then, turning partly to the
right, the holder supports the horse’s leg upon his left leg, in which
position he should always stand as quietly and firmly as possible. If,
now, the shoer desires to have both hands free to work upon the hoof,
he grasps the toe with the left hand in such a manner that the toe
rests firmly in the palm while the four fingers are closely applied
to the wall of the toe, takes a half step toward the rear, passes the
hoof behind his left knee into his right hand which has been passed
backward between his knees to receive it, and drawing the hoof forward
outward and upward supports it firmly on his two knees,—the legs just
above the knees being applied tightly against the pastern. The forefoot
should not be raised higher than the knee (carpus), nor the hind foot
higher than the hock, nor either foot be drawn too far backward. The
correct standing position of the shoer or floorman while holding a
front foot is shown in <a href="#FIG_91">Fig. 91</a>. Shortness of
stature (5′-5′.6″) is desirable in a floorman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>In lifting the <i>left hind foot</i> the animal should be gently
stroked back as far as the angle of the hip, against which the left
hand is placed for support, while the right hand strokes the limb down
to the middle of the cannon, which it grasps <i>from behind</i>. While
the left hand presses the animal’s weight over towards the right side,
the right hand loosens the foot and carries it forward and outward from
the body so that the limb is bent at the hock. The holder then turns
his body towards the right, brings his left leg against the anterior
surface of the fetlock-joint, and carries the foot backward, at which
time his left arm passes over the horse’s croup and above and to the
inner side of the hock. Finally, both hands encompass the long pastern.</p>

     <p class="center">Proper position for holding a front foot.</p>
</div>

<p>If the right feet are to be raised, the process is simply reversed.</p>

<p>In raising the feet no unnecessary pain should be inflicted by
pinching, squeezing, or lifting a limb too high. The wise shoer avoids
all unnecessary clamor and disturbance; quiet, rapid, painless methods
avail much more. In dealing with <i>young</i> horses the feet should
not be kept lifted too long; let them down from time to time. In
<i>old</i> and <i>stiff</i> horses the feet should not be lifted too
high, especially in the beginning of the shoeing.

     <p class="f120">The Martin horse rack (modified).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
<i>Vicious</i> horses must often be severely handled. Watch the play of
the ears and eyes continually, and immediately punish every exhibition
of temper either by jerking the halter or bridle vigorously, or by loud
commands. If this does not avail, then if soft ground is at hand make
the horse back as rapidly as possible for some time over this soft
surface; it is very disagreeable and tiresome to him. To raise a hind
foot we may knot a strong, broad, soft, plaited band (side-line) into
the tail, loop it about the fetlock of the hind foot, and hold the
end. This often renders valuable service. The holder seizes the band
close to the fetlock, draws the foot forward under the body, and then
holds it as above described. The use of such a band compels the horse
to carry a part of his own weight, and at the same time hinders him
from kicking. Before attempting to place this rope or band about the
fetlock, the front foot on the same side should be raised.</p>

<p>The various sorts of twitches are objectionable, and their use should
not be allowed unless some painful hoof operation is to be done. The
application of the tourniquet, or “Spanish windlass,” to the hind leg
is equally objectionable.</p>

<p>Those horses which resist our attempts to shoe them we do not
immediately cast or place in the stocks, but first have a quiet,
trustworthy man hold them by the bridle-reins and attempt by gentle
words and soft caresses to win their attention and confidence.</p>

<p><i>Ticklish</i> horses must be taken hold of boldly, for light touches
of the hand are to such animals much more unpleasant than energetic,
rough handling. Many ticklish horses allow their feet to be raised when
they are grasped suddenly without any preparatory movements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<h4 id="III_C">C. Removing the Old Shoes.</h4>

<p>If a horse’s hoofs are healthy, all the shoes may be taken off at the
same time, but there are certain diseases of the hoof in which this
should not be done.</p>

<p>The rule to follow in removing every shoe is to <i>draw it
cautiously</i>, not wrench it away with violence. Hoofs which are dirty
should first be cleansed, preferably with a stiff brush. Next, the
clinches should be <i>carefully</i> lifted by means of a rather dull
clinch cutter (<a href="#FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>), <i>without injuring the horn</i>
of the wall. In order, now, that the nails may be removed singly, the shoe must be
slightly lifted. This may be done in one of two ways. The shoer may use
a pair of pincers (<a href="#FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>), with broad bills which will
encompass the branch of the shoe and come well together underneath it. The
handles of the pincers are then moved <i>in the direction of the branches</i>
of the shoe. The second method consists in raising the branches of the
shoe by driving the nail-cutter from behind between the shoe and hoof
and using it as a lever or pry to loosen the shoe.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>Violent and excessive twisting of the hoof and straining of ligaments
may easily occur, but the smith should guard against them by supporting
the hoof with the left hand or with the leg just above the knee, while
loosening the shoe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<h4 id="III_D">D. Preparing the Hoof for the Shoe.</h4>

<p>This preparation is usually termed paring, trimming, or dressing. It is
a most important step in the process of shoeing, and its object is to
shorten the hoof, which has grown too long under the projection of the
shoe, and prepare it to receive the new shoe. The instruments needed
for this work are the rasp and the hoof-knife (<a href="#FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>);
upon large and hard hoofs a pair of sharp nippers (<a href="#FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>),
or a sharp <b>hewing knife, with broad handle and perfectly flat, smooth sides</b>,
may be used, since these instruments will considerably facilitate and hasten
the work.</p>

<div id="FIG_95" class="figcenter">
  <p class="f150">Fig. 95.</p>

     <p class="blockquot">German hoof set with detachable hook
         blades. (W. M. Kunde, Dresden): <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, hoof
         blades; <i>b</i>, pus searcher; <i>c</i>, scalpel.</p>
</div>

<p>After the shoer has carefully examined the hoofs in the manner
described upon pages 90, 91, and 92, and has fixed in mind the relation
of the height of the hoofs to the size and weight of the body, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
cleanses the hoof and removes all stubs of old
nails. At the same time he should be asking himself <i>if</i>,
<i>where</i>, and <i>how much</i> horn is to be removed. In all cases
all loosely attached fragments of horn are to be removed, for example,
chips of horn produced by repeated bending and stretching of the lower
border of the wall. The sole is then freed from all flakes of dead
horn. The shoer then runs the rasp around the outer border of the
wall and breaks it off to the depth to which he thinks it should be
shortened, and then <b>cuts the wall down to its union with the sole,
so that at least one-eighth of an inch of the edge of the sole lies
in the same level as the bearing-surface of the wall</b>. Finally,
the wall, white line, and outer margin of the sole, forming the
“bearing-surface,” must be rasped until they are perfectly horizontal,
except that at the toe of fore-hoofs this bearing-surface may be rasped
slightly upward (rolled toe).</p>

<p>In dressing the hoof the <b>branches</b> of the frog should always
be left prominent enough to project beyond the bearing-surface of
the quarters about the thickness of an ordinary flat shoe. If it
be weakened by paring, it is deprived of its activity, shrinks,
and the hoof becomes narrow to a corresponding degree. The frog
should, therefore, be <i>trimmed</i> only when it is really <i>too
prominent</i>. However, loose and diseased particles of horn may be
trimmed away when it is affected with thrush.</p>

<div id="FIG_96" class="figcenter">
  <p class="f150">Fig. 96.</p>
  <img  src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="178" />
     <p class="f120">Nippers.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>bars</i> should be spared and never <b>shortened</b> except when
too long. Their union with the wall at the quarters must in no case be
weakened, and never cut through (opening up the heels). They should be
left as high as the wall at the quarters, or only a little less, while
the branches of the sole should lie about one-eighth of an inch lower.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>The <i>buttress</i> (angle formed by the union of wall and bar)
requires special attention. In healthy unshod hoofs the bars run
backward and outward in a straight line from the anterior third of the
frog. In shod hoofs, however, it happens that the buttresses gradually
lengthen, curl inward, and press upon the branches of the frog, causing
the latter to shrink. In such cases the indication is to remove these
prolongations of horn from the buttresses so as to restore to the bars
their normal direction.</p>

<p><b>The sharp edge of the plantar border of the wall should be broken

its absolute thickness.</b> (<a href="#FIG_97">Fig. 97</a>). However,
in healthy hoofs, that is, in those whose <i>walls are straight from
the coronet to the ground</i>, the outer surface of the wall should
<b>never</b> <i>be rasped</i>. The only exceptions to this rule are
those cases in which there is an outward bending of the lower edge of
the wall, most frequent on the inner side wall and quarter.</p>

<p>In the <i>base-wide</i> position of the limbs the plantar hoof-surface

slanting than the inner.

<p>In this also the foot-axis is our guide. If this axis is as it should
be, the wall at the toe and the long pastern will have the <b>same
slant</b> (<a href="#FIG_67">Figs. 67</a>, <a href="#FIG_68">68</a>
and <a href="#FIG_69">69</a>). If the hoof has become too long under
the protection of the shoe, this will be shown by the foot-axis being
no longer a straight line, but broken backward at the coronet (<a href="#FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>);
that is, the hoof in comparison with the fetlock will be too
slanting. By shortening the toe more than the quarters this faulty
relation will be corrected (<a href="#FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>) and the foot restored
to its proper slant. If the quarters are too long (too high) in comparison
with the length of the toe, the foot-axis will be broken forward at the
coronet (<a href="#FIG_99">Fig. 99</a>), and the hoof will be too upright.
By shortening the quarters more than the toe the foot-axis may be made
straight. <b>The plantar surface of the hoof is therefore correct
(balanced) when the horse places the foot flat upon the ground in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
travelling</b>, and when the lines bounding the hoof, viewed from in
front, from behind, and in profile, correspond to the direction of the
three phalanges (foot-axis).</p>

<p>Finally, this fact should be emphasized, that in changing from flat
shoes to those with calks, or the reverse, the hoofs must first be
dressed in accordance, so that the foot axes will remain straight, and
the feet be set always flat to the ground when the new shoes are on.
Each hoof, when ready for the new shoe, should be let down and the
horse allowed to stand upon it while it is again carefully examined
and closely compared with the opposite hoof. Only after such close
inspection has proved the dressing to be faultless can the hoof be
considered as properly prepared and ready for the shoe. <i>The two
front hoofs and the two hind hoofs, when the legs are in the same
position, should not only be of equal size, but also in proper relation
to the size and weight of the body</i>.</p>

<h4 id="III_E">E. Preparing the Hoof for going Barefoot.</h4>

<p>This becomes necessary when the nature of the ground and the kind of
service required of the horse render shoeing unnecessary. However, to
go barefoot the hoof must have <b>plenty of horn</b>. After removing
the shoes the <b>frog should be pared down nearly to the level of the
wall</b>, and the sharp outer edge of the wall well <b>rounded off</b>
with the rasp, in some cases as far as the white line, otherwise large
pieces of the wall will readily break away. Hoofs with very slanting
walls must be more strongly rounded off than upright hoofs. Going
barefoot strengthens the hoofs. From time to time the condition of
these shoeless hoofs should be ascertained by inspection, and any
growing fault in shape or direction of the horn immediately corrected.
It quite frequently happens that the sharp edge of the wall must be
repeatedly rounded, especially on very oblique walls (outer half of
base-wide hoofs), and the quarters may require frequent shortening,
because they are not always worn away as fast as the horn at the toe.

<h4 id="III_F">F. Making Shoes.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h4>

<p>Besides good, tough iron for the shoe, we need an anvil with a round
horn and a small hole at one end, a round-headed turning-hammer, a
round sledge, a stamping hammer, a pritchel of good steel, and, if
a fullered shoe is to be made, a round fuller. Bodily activity and,
above all else, a good eye for measurement are not only desirable, but
necessary. A shoe should be made thoughtfully, but yet quickly enough
to make the most of the heat.</p>

<p><b>The iron</b> of which horseshoes are made is derived from the
natural iron ore. Iron used for technical purposes is not chemically
pure. Pure iron is rather too soft, and is therefore mixed with
different substances, mostly with “carbon,” the most important
ingredient of our fuel. Of course, the iron contains a very small
quantity of carbon (0.5 to 5 per cent.). When iron contains more than
2.2 per cent. of carbon it is hard, brittle, and more easily melted,
and is known as crude iron, or raw iron, because it is derived from
the raw product,—black ore. The melted crude iron is called <i>cast
iron</i>. Iron is ductile when it contains less than 2.2 per cent.
of carbon, and is then called forge iron, or <i>wrought iron</i>.
Wrought iron is fusible only at a high temperature. Only weldable iron
containing less than 1.6 per cent. of carbon is suitable for general
use. Of this iron we distinguish two sorts,—steel and wrought iron.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
A larger percentage of carbon is found in steel than in wrought iron.
Steel is hard, can be tempered, and may be called tempered wrought
iron. In order to temper or harden steel, bring it to a cherry-red
heat, and then cool it suddenly by dipping it in cold water or wet
sand. The tempered steel can again be softened as desired by heating
and slowly cooling. By heating to a high temperature in a forge wrought
iron will become doughy, and may then be intimately united (welded)
with another piece at the same temperature by pressure or hammering.
This property is called weld-ability; it is of great importance in
making horseshoes. The heating of iron until it reaches the welding
stage is called getting a “heat.” The act of welding wrought iron with
steel is called “steeling.”</p>

<p>Regarding <b>the tools</b>, the following hints are sufficient:</p>

<p>The <i>anvil</i> should have a level, smooth, flat steel face.</p>

<p>Likewise, the round head and flat face of both <i>turning-hammer</i>
and <i>sledge</i> should be smooth.</p>

<p>On the <i>fullering-hammer</i> (<a href="#FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>) the left side
is flat, the right side convex, and the cutting edge has slightly rounded corners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>The <i>hardy</i>, <i>fullering-hammer</i>, and <i>cold chisel</i>
should be flawless on the edge.</p>

<p>The <i>punch</i> (<a href="#FIG_102">Fig. 102</a>), used to make the nail-holes
in the shoe, has a dull point, which should correspond in size with the head of the
horseshoe-nail and have slightly rounded corners.</p>

<p>The <i>pritchel</i> (<a href="#FIG_103">Fig. 103</a>) should not taper to a point,
but should end in a rectangular surface whose length is twice its width, in order
to punch iron through the shoe under the blow of the hammer.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Making the Shoe.</b></p>

<p>To make a flat shoe, take the length of the hoof from the point of
the toe to the buttress and the greatest width of the hoof; these two
measurements, when added together, give the length of the bar for the
shoe. The bar should be of such width and thickness as will require the
least amount of working. For a bar-shoe or a shoe with heel-calks the
bar must be correspondingly longer.</p>

<p>Should we wish to preserve the exact outline of the plantar border
of the wall, we may advantageously use such a <i>podometer</i> as is
shown in <a href="#FIG_104">Fig. 104</a>. This consists of a perforated sheet-iron
plate one-sixteenth to one-twelfth of an inch thick. This is laid upon the
hoof, and the outline of the wall marked upon it with chalk.</p>

<p>If necessary, the hoof may be set on a piece of smooth, stiff wrapping
paper or card-board, and the outline of the wall closely traced with a
lead pencil.

  <img  src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="486" />
     <p class="center">Podometer.</p>
</div>

<p>To make a <b>front shoe</b> (<a href="#FIG_107">Figs. 107</a>
and <a href="#FIG_108">108</a>), heat the bar white-hot
just beyond its middle, place the head of the sledge hammer across
one end of the face of the anvil, hold the unheated end of the bar on
the head of the sledge,—the heated end resting on the face of the
anvil, and bend the bar into a half-circle with the round head of the
turning-hammer. (The outer branch of all shoes is made first; in making
pairs the right shoe is made first.) The extreme end of the heated
bar is drawn out to the desired width and thickness with the sledge.
The bent branch is then placed obliquely across the heel of the horn
of the anvil, is turned over toward the right till it rests upon an
edge, and is then bevelled diamond-shaped from the toe to the end of
the branch. [The edge in contact with the horn is the inner edge of
the right branch (outer branch) of the right shoe; the edge beaten
down by the hammer is the outer edge of the outer branch.] The branch
is then flattened on the anvil because in the bending the outer edge
has been stretched and thinned, while the iron of the inner edge has
been crowded together (back-set) and thickened. In flattening, the shoe
should be left a trifle thinner on the inner edge. The branch is again
placed over the horn, and gone over lightly with the flat head of the
turning-hammer and brought to a proper shape. It is now to be concaved
with or without the help of the sledge, or the concaving may be
omitted. The concaving should end about three-fourths of an inch from
the end of the branch. Now turn the branch and fuller it, or fuller
it first and concave afterwards. The fuller should be set in about
one-twelfth of an inch from the edge for small shoes, somewhat more for
large shoes, and led from the end of the branch towards the toe, twice
being necessary to make the fullering of sufficient depth. Next, stamp
the holes, punch them through with the pritchel, run over the surfaces,
go over the outer edge of the shoe upon the horn, and, finally, hammer
the bearing-surface smooth and horizontal. The left branch is made in
the same way, except that it is turned to the left and the fullering
carried from the toe to the heel. <b>Any ordinary shoe can and should
be completed in the rough in two heats.</b> One pair of shoes requires
from eight to fifteen minutes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The <b>hind shoe</b> (<a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>) is made in like manner,
but the branches are not bent in a circle but given that form shown in
<a href="#FIG_106">Fig. 106</a>. Concaving is not necessary; it is sufficient
merely to round the inner edge of the web.</p>

     <p class="center">The curvature of a branch of a hind shoe.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Since in bending the shoe, and especially the toe of a hind shoe, the
inner edge is crowded together (back-set) and thickened to the same
extent that the outer edge is stretched and thinned, we must remember
to do away with these inequalities of thickness and strain by hammering
the shoe smooth.</p>

<p class="f120"><b>Peculiarities of the Shoe.</b></p>

<p>They are dependent upon the structure, direction, and position of the
leg and hoof, as well as upon the horse’s service and the nature of the
ground. Since the shoe is an artificial base of support, and since a
proper surface of support is of the greatest importance in preserving
the soundness of the feet and legs, careful attention must be given to
this matter. Naturally shoes designed for the various forms of hoofs
must present equally great and equally numerous differences of form, as
well as other peculiarities.</p>

<p><b>General Properties.</b> 1. <b>Form.</b>—A form corresponding to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
shape of the hoof is indispensable in every shoe. Front and hind
and right and left shoes should be sharply defined and easily
distinguishable. <i>Front shoes</i> must, above all else, be circular
<i>round cut the toe</i>. <i>Hind shoes</i>, on the contrary, should be
<i>round pointed at the toe</i>, yet not too much so, but as in <a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>.</p>

<p>2. <b>Width.</b>—All shoes should be wider webbed (more covered) at
the toe than at the ends of the branches. The medium width should be
about twice the thickness of the wall.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">

         <i>a</i>, bearing-surface;<br /> <i>b</i>, concaving, or “seating.”</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>3. <b>Thickness.</b>—Each shoe should, in general terms, be so thick
that it need not be renewed under four weeks. Lungwitz found that the
average required thickness is about seven-sixteenths of an inch. Of
course, this thickness must be diminished or increased according to
the rapidity of wear of the shoe. <i>Shoes without calks should be of
uniform thickness</i>, unless there are special reasons for making them
otherwise.</p>

<p>4. <b>Length.</b>—For draft-horses they should be long enough to reach
the bulbs of the heel, otherwise shorter, though in other respects
they may differ (<a href="#SPEC_PROP">see “special properties”</a>), but should
in all cases completely cover the bearing-surface of the hoof.</p>

<p>5. <b>Surfaces.</b>—That part of the hoof-surface of the shoe which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
is in contact with the hoof (bearing-surface of the shoe, <a href="#FIG_109">Fig. 109, <i>a</i></a>)
should be horizontal and wide enough to cover the wall,
the white line, and from a twelfth to an eighth of an inch of the
outer edge of the sole. Shoes for large hoofs require a broader
bearing-surface than those for small hoofs. The concaving, or “seating”
(<a href="#FIG_109">Fig. 109, <i>b</i></a>), should be made deeper or shallower,
according to the nature of the sole. <i>Shoes for hoofs with strongly arched</i>
(very concave) <i>soles, do not require any concaving</i> (hind hoofs,
narrow fore-hoofs). <i>The object of concaving is to prevent pressure
of the shoe upon the horny sole except at its margin.</i></p>

          or “crease”; <i>d</i>, nail-hole.</p>
</div>

<p>The ground-surface of the shoe should be flat and <i>perfectly
horizontal</i>, except at the toe, which may be turned upward (rolled
toe, “rolling motion”).</p>

<p>6. <b>Borders.</b>—The <i>outer border</i> should usually be
moderately <i>base-narrow</i>,—that is, the circumference of the
ground-surface of the shoe should be less than the circumference of
its hoof-surface; in other words, the entire outer border of the shoe
should be bevelled under the foot. Shoes made base-narrow are not so
easily loosened, and materially assist in preventing interfering. The
<i>inner border</i> should be moderately rounded.</p>

<p>7. <b>The “Fullering”</b> (<a href="#FIG_109">Fig. 109, <i>c</i></a>).—In depth it
should be about two-thirds the thickness of the shoe, of uniform width, and
“clean.” A fullering is not absolutely necessary, but it makes the shoe
lighter in proportion to its size, facilitates a uniform placing of the
nail-holes, renders the ground-surface somewhat rough, and, because it
is rather difficult to make, increases the workman’s skill.

<p>8. <b>Nail-Holes</b> (<a href="#FIG_109">Fig. 109, <i>d</i></a>).—<b>The importance
of the nail-holes</b>, as regards their <i>character</i>, <i>number</i>,
<i>distribution</i>, <i>depth</i>, and <i>direction</i>, <b>cannot
be over-estimated</b>, because by the nails which are driven through
them the stability of the shoe upon the hoof should be maintained
without injuring the sensitive structures, splitting the horny wall,
or immoderately interfering with the elasticity of the foot. Each
nail-hole should taper uniformly from the ground to the hoof-surface
(funnel-shaped). For a medium-weight shoe six nail-holes are
sufficient, while for all heavy shoes, especially those with toe- and
heel-calks, eight are indicated; however, it should by no means be said
that every nail-hole should contain a nail. Hind shoes usually require
one more nail-hole than front shoes, yet seldom more than eight. In
front shoes the nail-holes should be placed in the anterior half of the
shoe (<a href="#FIG_107">Figs. 107</a> and <a href="#FIG_108">108</a>),
while in hind shoes they are to be placed in the anterior two-thirds
of the shoe (<a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>), and in both cases so distributed
that the toe shall be without nail-holes, except in those shoes in which
it may be desirable to omit the nail-holes in an entire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
branch (<a href="#FIG_153">Fig. 153</a>). <b>The depth of the nail-holes</b>—that
is, their distance from the outer edge of the shoe—will depend always upon the
thickness of the wall, and <b>should equal the absolute</b> (real)
<b>thickness of the wall</b> (<a href="#FIG_97">Fig. 97</a>). It is evident, therefore,
that all nail-holes should not be placed at the same depth (for thickness of
the wall, <a href="#Page_53">see p. 53</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>direction</b> in which the nail-holes should pass through the
shoe depends upon the obliquity of the wall. The nail-holes around the
toe, as a rule, should incline somewhat inward, the holes at the sides
less so, while those at the quarters should be punched straight,—that
is, should pass perpendicularly through the shoe.</p>

<p>Both front and hind shoes for army horses in time of war and manœuvres
should be so punched that one or two nails may be placed in the
posterior half of the shoe (<a href="#FIG_111">Figs. 111</a> and
<a href="#FIG_112">112</a>).</p>

            indifferent; <i>c</i>, faulty.</p>
</div>

<p>9. <b>Clips</b> (<a href="#FIG_113">Fig. 113</a>) are <i>half-circular,
leaf-like ears</i> drawn upward from the outer edge of the shoe. They
should be strong and without flaw at the base, and somewhat <b>higher
and thicker</b> upon hind than upon front shoes. Their height on flat
shoes should equal the thickness of the shoe, while on shoes with
leather soles, or with toe- and heel-calks they should be somewhat higher.</p>

<p>According to their position we distinguish toe- and side-clips. They
secure the shoe against shifting; therefore, as a rule, every shoe
should have a toe-clip. A side-clip should always be drawn up on that
branch of the shoe which first meets the ground in locomotion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p><b>A Shoe with Heel-Calks.</b>—All shoes with heel-calks designed for
healthy hoofs should be so made and applied that they will disturb the
normal setting down of the foot as little as possible, that the wear of
the shoe will take place uniformly, and slipping be diminished. The toe
of the shoe must, therefore, be left somewhat thicker than the branches
just in front of the heel-calks. Moreover, every front shoe with
heel-calks must be relatively long, and be provided with considerable
rolling motion at the toe; that is, the shoe should be turned up at the
toe, the bending beginning near the inner edge of the web. The three-
or four-cornered, somewhat conical heel-calks with rounded corners
should not be higher than the thickness of the shoe. With reference to
the direction of the ends of the branches, we should see to it that
they do not rise excessively, but that they assume as near as possible
a horizontal direction in passing back to the heels (<a href="#FIG_115">see Fig. 115</a>).</p>

<p><b>A Shoe with Toe- and Heel-Calks.</b>—Such a shoe should be of
uniform thickness from end to end, and should have a toe-calk and two
heel-calks that are somewhat stronger and longer than the heel-calks
of a shoe which has no toe-calk. If to a shoe of uniform thickness, on
which the heel-calks are somewhat higher than those already described,
a piece of steel (<a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116, <i>b</i></a>) of the height
of the heel-calks is welded at the toe, we have a shoe with toe- and
heel-calks. The toe-calk should never he higher than the heel-calks.
There are three principal kinds of toe-calks,—namely:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Sharp Toe-Calk.</i>—A bar of toe-steel of proper width and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
thickness for the toe-calk is thrust with the shoe into the fire. When
the end of the bar is cherry-red in color it is withdrawn, laid across
the straight hardy, and cut nearly through at a point a calk-length
from the end. Bar and shoe are then brought to a welding heat, the
calk quickly and securely welded across the toe of the shoe, the bar
wrenched away, the calk gone over again with the hammer, when it is
immediately beaten out to a sharp edge from the anterior face, either
over the far edge of the anvil, or in a foot-vise. The posterior face
of a sharp toe-calk should be perpendicular to the ground-surface
of the shoe. Machine-made toe-calks, sharp, half-sharp and blunt,
provided with a sharp spud at one or both ends, are in general use.
Their use requires two heats, and the sharp calk is blunted in the welding.</p>

     and <i>e</i>, the least width of the base of support of
     this shoe with calks.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <i>The Blunt Toe-Calk.</i>—It is a rather long rectangular piece
of toe-steel, straight, or curved to conform to the toe of the shoe.
The shoe-surface and the ground-surface of the calk are of equal
dimensions. It should be welded on in one heat.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Half-Sharp Toe-Calk</i> (Coffin-Lid Toe-Calk).—It resembles
the blunt calk, except that the surface of the calk that is applied to
the shoe is somewhat broader and longer than the surface that comes in
contact with the ground. It is welded on in one heat. The first and
third kinds are most suitable for winter.</p>

<p>Since heel-and toe-calks raise the hoof far from the ground and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
prevent all pressure upon the frog, they diminish the elasticity of
the hoof and injure it. They are injurious also to the joints, because
they furnish a base of support which is essentially smaller than that
afforded by a flat shoe (<a href="#FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>). However,
they are indispensable for heavy draft purposes on <i>slippery</i>
roads and in winter. Upon all other roads and in summer they are
superfluous, at least upon front hoofs, especially as they do not
wholly prevent slipping.</p>

<p id="SPEC_PROP"><b>Special Properties.</b>—The many different forms of hoofs require a
great variety of shoes. Following are the special peculiarities of each
of the chief classes of shoes.</p>

<p id="SHOE_1">1. <i>Shoe for a Regular Hoof.</i>—Outer edge: moderately base-narrow
(bevelled under) all around. Distribution and direction of the
nail-holes: regular. Length: longer than the hoof by the thickness of
the shoe (<a href="#FIG_121">see Figs. 121</a> and <a href="#FIG_122">122</a>).</p>

<p id="SHOE_2">2. <i>Shoe for an Acute-Angled Hoof.</i>—Outer edge: strongly
base-narrow around the toe, but gradually becoming perpendicular
towards the ends of the branches. Punching: regular, except that the
nail-holes at the toe must incline inward somewhat more than usual.
Length: rather longer than the preceding shoe (<a href="#FIG_123">see Fig. 123</a>).</p>

<p id="SHOE_3">3. <i>Shoe for an Upright</i> (stumpy) <i>Hoof</i>.—Outer edge:
perpendicular at the toe; but if the hoof is very steep, then base-wide
at the toe,—<i>i.e.</i>, bevelled downward and outward. Punching: last
nail should be placed just beyond the middle of the shoe. Direction of
the holes: perpendicular. Length: short; at most, one-eighth of an inch
longer than the hoof. In the case of a “bear-foot” (<a href="#FIG_70">see Fig. 70</a>)
the shoe should be long.</p>

<p id="SHOE_4">4. <i>Shoe for a Base-Wide Hoof.</i>—Outer edge; the outer branch
should be moderately base-narrow,—<i>i.e.</i>, bevelled downward and
inward, the inner branch perpendicular. Punching: upon the outer branch
the holes should extend well back, while upon the inner branch they
are to be crowded forward towards the toe (<a href="#FIG_117">see Fig. 117</a>).
Length will depend upon the obliquity of the hoof as seen in profile
(<a href="#SHOE_1">see 1</a>, <a href="#SHOE_2">2</a>, and <a href="#SHOE_3">3</a>).</p>

<p id="SHOE_5">5. <i>Shoe for a Base-Narrow Hoof.</i>—Outer edge: the outer branch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
either perpendicular or base-wide, the inner branch strongly
base-narrow. Punching: the nail-holes in the outer branch should be
crowded towards the toe and, under certain conditions, punched deeper
than the wall is thick, on account of the greater width of this branch;
in the inner branch the nail-holes are to be distributed back to the
quarter and punched light (<a href="#FIG_118">see Fig. 118</a>). Length will
depend upon the obliquity of the hoof. The outer branch should be about
one-fourth of an inch longer than the inner.</p>

<p>The forms of shoes described in paragraphs 2 to 7 differ from that
described in paragraph 1, but are necessary in order to lessen the
injurious consequences of irregular loading (unbalancing) of the feet,
and of unfavorable bases of support of the body-weight.</p>

<h4 id="III_G">G. Choosing the Shoe.</h4>

<p>The choice of the shoe for a given horse is not at all difficult after
we have carefully considered his weight, the nature of his work, his
standing position, gait, the form of his hoofs, and quality of the
horn, bearing in mind the general and peculiar properties of shoes.
As a rule, we choose a shoe that is longer than the hoof, because the
latter grows and carries the shoe forward with it, and because the
quarters gradually become lowered by rubbing and wearing away upon the
branches of the shoe. The <b>length</b> of the shoe is of especial
importance. For horses employed for slow, heavy draft purposes the shoe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
supplied with heel-and toe-calks should extend backward far
enough to support the bulbs of the heels. On the contrary,
horses used at a trot or gallop, as coach-and saddle-horses,
require shorter shoes (<a href="#FIG_124">see Fig. 124</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>weight</i> of the shoe should be so adjusted to the demands
of the horse’s work, the condition of the legs (whether used up
with work or not), and the nature of the ground that the shoeing
will last <i>at least a month</i>. Hard roads and a heavy, clumsy
gait require strong, durable shoes, which, under some conditions,
are to be rendered still more durable by welding in
steel. For moderate service upon soft roads we should use
light shoes. Running horses require unusually thin and narrow
shoes of steel (<a href="#FIG_125">see Figs. 125-128</a>).</p>

<h4 id="III_H">H. Shaping and Fitting Shoes.<br /> General Considerations.</h4>

<p>This is one of the most important parts of horseshoeing. Its object is
to so fashion or shape the shoe which has been chosen for a particular
hoof that its circumference will exactly correspond to the lower
circumference of the previously prepared hoof, and its bearing-surface
will fit air-tight to the bearing-surface of the hoof. At this time all
defects in the surfaces of hoof and shoe and in the nail-holes must
be remedied, the clips drawn up, and the shoe made to fit perfectly.
The bearing-surface of the shoe, especially at the ends of the
branches, must be kept <b>horizontal</b><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and smooth, and its width regulated by the width of the bearing-surface
of the hoof (<a href="#Page_99">see page 99</a>). Perfectly <i>uniform heating</i>
is absolutely indispensable in shaping the shoe, because an irregularly
heated shoe twists or becomes distorted at the warm places. Every shoe
should be straight, and when held before the eye one branch should
exactly cover the other. A flat shoe laid upon a level surface should
touch at all parts of its ground-surface; the only exception to this is
the shoe with a rolled toe (rolling motion), in which the toe is turned
upward. A shoe is termed “<i>trough-shaped</i>” when only the inner
edge of the web rests upon the flat surface. It is faulty, disturbs the
stability of the foot, and shifts the weight of the body too much upon
the quarters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <p id="FIG_121" class="f150">Fig. 121.</p>
  <img  src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="278" />
     <p class="center">Shod fore-hoof viewed in profile<br />
            to show the “roll” at the toe.</p>
</div>

<p>To front shoes we give a <b>rolled toe</b> (<a href="#FIG_121">Fig. 121</a>,
rolling motion), by which we mean a more or less pronounced upward
turn of the toe of the shoe. Ordinarily, the toe begins to turn
up at the middle of the web, and should be elevated about one-half
the thickness of the iron. The rolled toe corresponds to
the natural wear of front hoofs, facilitates the “breaking over”
of the feet, and insures a uniform wear of the shoe (<a href="#FIG_86">see Fig. 86</a>).
The shoe is made moderately hot and placed on the foot
with the toe-clip against the wall exactly in front of the point
of the frog. The scorched horn should be repeatedly removed
with the rasp until a perfect-fitting bed has been made upon
the bearing-surface of the hoof. From the bearing-surface of
the shoe to the inner border of the web the iron must be free
from the sole around its entire circumference. The horn sole
should not be burnt, because the velvety tissue of the sole lies
immediately above it. In the region of the nail-holes the outer
borders of shoe and wall should correspond.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
<b>The nail-holes must under all conditions cover the white line.</b>
From the last nail-hale back to the ends of the branches, for hoofs of
the regular standing position of the limbs, the shoe should gradually
widen until it projects at each quarter from a sixteenth to an eighth
of an inch beyond the edge of the wall. The posterior half of the
shoe should, therefore, be somewhat wider than the hoof. The effect
of this will be to prolong the usefulness of the shoes. With respect
to the <i>width of the branches</i>, an exception arises in the case
of <i>hind shoes</i>, in which the inner branch, with few exceptions,
should closely follow the border of the wall; this will prevent
interfering and tearing off the shoe by the opposite foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <p id="FIG_122" class="f150">Fig. 122.</p>
  <img  src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="457" />
     <p class="center">Left fore-hoof of normal position shod.</p>
</div>

<p>Between the ends of the branches and the frog there should be enough
room, with few exceptions, to pass a foot-pick.</p>

<p>In order to judge of the width of a shoe which has been fitted to
the hoof, it is of advantage to seize the hoof in the left hand and,
extending it towards the ground, to observe from behind and above the
outer border of the shoe and the surfaces of the wall.</p>

<p><i>Furthermore, the most important rule is that the shoe should
always have the form of the foot, so long as the form of the hoof
remains unaltered. In all hoofs that have already undergone
change of form we must strive to give the shoe that form which
the hoof had before it underwent change.</i> Such treatment will
not only do the hoof no injury, but, on the contrary, is of
advantage to it, as it is well known that in time the hoof will
acquire the form of the shoe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p id="III_H_1" class="f120"><b>Shaping and Fitting Shoes.<br />
Special Considerations.</b></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>A shoe for a hoof of the regular form fits properly</i> when
the outer border of the shoe in the region of the nail-holes closely
follows the outer edge of the wall, but from the last nail-hole to
the end of each branch extends beyond the wall from a sixteenth
to an eighth of an inch, the shoe is straight, lies firmly and air-tight
upon the bearing-surface of the hoof, the nail-holes fall
exactly upon the white line, and there is sufficient space between
the frog and the branches of the shoe for the passage of a foot-pick.
The branches must be of equal length.</p>

<p>While in fitting a shoe to a hoof of regular form we need
pay attention only to the form of the hoof, <i>it is very different
when we come to shape and fit shoes to hoofs of irregular forms</i>.
<i>In these cases we must consider not only the form of the hoof,
but the position of the limbs and the distribution of weight in
the hoof</i>, because <b>where the most weight falls the surface of
support of the foot must be widened, and where least weight
falls</b> (<b>on the opposite side</b>) <b>the surface of support must
be narrowed</b>. In this manner the improper distribution of weight
within the hoof (an unbalanced foot) is regulated,—that is, is
evenly distributed over the surface of support. The manner
in which this is accomplished in the various forms of hoofs is
as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>An acute-angled hoof</i> requires the shoe described in
<a href="#SHOE_2">paragraph 2, page 114</a>. The branches must be long,
because more of the weight falls in the posterior half of the foot, and
long branches extend the surface of support backward, while
the surface of support in front is to be diminished by making
the toe of the shoe base-narrow, either by turning it up or by
bevelling it in under the foot. A shoe for an acute-angled hoof
fits when it is otherwise related to the hoof as is described in
paragraph <i>a</i>, above.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>An upright or stumpy hoof</i> presents exactly reverse
conditions with respect to the distribution of weight within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the hoof, and is treated in an exactly opposite manner. The
surface of support should be increased at the toe and diminished
at the quarters. This is accomplished by a shoe possessing the
peculiarities described in <a href="#SHOE_3">paragraph 3, page 114</a>,
whose nail-holes are directed either straight or slightly outward.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>A base-wide hoof</i> requires the surface of support
to be widened upon the inner side of the foot and narrowed upon the
outer side, because the inner half of the foot hears the more
weight. A shoe having the peculiarities described in <a href="#SHOE_4">paragraph
4, page 114</a>, accomplishes this end.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The base-narrow hoof</i> is just the reverse of the
preceding, and requires a shoe whose peculiarities are described in
<a href="#SHOE_5">paragraph 5, page 114</a>. While in the normal standing
position of the limbs, viewed from in front, the ends of the branches
of the shoe should be equally distant from the middle of the
median lacuna of the frog, this is not so in the base-wide and
base-narrow positions. In the base-wide position the outer and
in the base-narrow position the inner branch should be somewhat
farther from the median lacuna than the branch of the
opposite side.</p>

therefore, the shoe designed for it should possess the peculiarities
enumerated in <a href="#SHOE_6">paragraph 6, page 115</a>.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>The narrow hoof</i> has already too narrow a base of
support, and must not be made smaller; therefore, the shoe should
not have a base-narrow but a perpendicular outer border, as

<p id="III_H_2" class="f120"><b>Shoeing Saddlers and Hunters.</b></p>

<p><i>The shoes for saddlers</i> (Park Hacks) should be light, short,
and fitted snug to prevent forging, interfering and pulling of the
shoes. The hoof-surface should cover the wall, white line and at
least one-fourth of an inch of the margin of the sole. An average
width of one inch is desirable. Both front and hind shoes should be
fullered and concaved on the ground-surface (convex iron). <b>The
Front Shoe</b>:—<i>Length</i>, should not project beyond the buttress
more than one-eighth of an inch. <i>Width</i>, an inch at the middle
on the branches, somewhat more at the toe, and less at the ends of
the branches. <i>Bevelling</i>, outer border, base-narrow all around.
The ends of the branches, and the heel-calks, in case they are used,
are bevelled strongly downward and forward under the foot. The toe
is rolled from the inner edge of the web, and provided with a strong
central clip. Six nails are sufficient (<a href="#FIG_124">see Fig. 124</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Hind Shoe</b>:—<i>Length</i>, the shoe may project from one-fourth
to three-eighths of an inch behind the buttresses. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
toe should be well rounded and somewhat blunt so that the
horn of the toe will project beyond the shoe an amount equal to
one-half the thickness of the wall. <i>Width</i>, somewhat less than
the front shoe. The branches are of equal thickness, and should
carry heel-calks whose height equals the thickness of the
shoe. To guard against interfering the inside calk may be
omitted and the inner branch thickened, fitted snug and bevelled
strongly base-narrow. Clips are to be placed at inner and outer
toes. Seven nails are sufficient.</p>

<p><i>The shoes for hunters</i> do not differ materially from those
suitable for Park Hacks. The hunter’s shoes are somewhat
lighter, and to guard against injury to the feet by over-reaching
and interfering, and against the shoes being pulled by stiff mire
and by treading, the shoes must represent merely a prolongation
of the hoofs, <i>i.e.</i>, must be no longer and no wider than the hoofs
themselves. <b>The front shoe</b> of narrow, convex iron is rolled at
the toe and has a central toe-clip. Forging heel-calks are advisable.</p>

<p><b>The hind shoe</b> is set back at the toe, carries inner and outer
toe-clips, an outer heel-calk and an inner interfering branch.
Seven nails.</p>

<p>Racing plates are intended solely to prevent excessive wear
and breaking away of the wall, and to insure a secure foothold
upon the ground. The shoes are made as light as possible,
but they must not be so narrow and thin that they will bend
or break. They are therefore made of steel, wide enough to
cover the bearing-surface of the wall, white line, and an eighth
of an inch of the sole. The ground-surface is divided into two
sharp edge’s by a deep, clean, fullering continued entirely
around the shoe. heel-calks are of no advantage. Front and
hind shoes carry six nails. The last nails are well back in the
quarters to prevent the spreading or bending of the light shoe.
Front shoes are provided with central toe-clips; hind shoes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
carry inner and outer toe-clips and are set slightly under at the toe

(1912) the average weight of the front shoes was 6⅚ ounces, of the
hind shoes 4 ounces. Of the seven swiftest pacers of the same year the
front shoes averaged 5½ ounces, and the hind shoes 3⅝ ounces. In short,
<i>extreme speed at running, pacing or trotting demands as light a shoe
as can be made, which will at the same time furnish a bearing for wall,
white line and a narrow rim of the sole</i>.</p>

<p>In style of shoes there is no marked difference between trotters
and pacers—except in the hind shoes of pacers that cross-fire (<a href="#Page_140">see
“cross-firing,” p. 140</a>). Open shoes predominate. Bar-shoes are used,
not to give frog pressure, but to stiffen and prevent spreading of
the shoe, when after a few days’ wear it becomes thin at the toe. The
average trotting and pacing plate is so thin that it would be weakened
by fullering, so most of them are stamped (punched). Six nails are
sufficient. Clips are seldom needed.</p>

<p>Pacers usually require a low circular grab or “rim” at the toe. This is
set flush with the outer border, is about one-eighth of an inch high
and is brazed on. Trotting plates are usually without toe-calks, though
many are fullered across the toe (corrugated) to furnish a grip upon
the ground.</p>

<p>On both trotting and pacing shoes the heel-calks should be low and
sharp and should run straight forward so as not to retard the forward
glide of the foot as it is set to earth heel first. The heel-calk
serves chiefly to prevent the lateral twist of the foot as the horse
takes the sharp turns of the track.</p>

<p>Freak shoes, toe-weights, side-weights, excessive length of hoof or
toe, and other unscientific appliances and methods of shoeing speed
horses are being gradually eliminated, and today the fastest are dressed
and shod in accordance with the principles enunciated in this book.</p>

<p id="III_H_5" class="f120"><b>Fitting Shoes to Heavy Draft-Horses.</b></p>

<p>What has been previously said concerning shoeing holds good here;
however, the conditions of shoeing are somewhat different in heavy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
horses, and particularly with respect to hoofs which, without being
clearly diseased, have been injured by shoeing. The entire operation
requires more circumspection, because it is more difficult. In many
cases one will find that the width that has been advised for the
outer branch of the shoe at the quarter is not sufficient. Indeed,
if a horse has wry feet, and there is unequal distribution of weight
within the hoof, and we attempt in shoeing it to follow to the letter
the directions given on preceding pages, we would be apt to favor the
perpetuation of the defect. In such cases the slant of the wall at the
quarters is of the greatest practical value to us in estimating the
proper width for the shoe at this point.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <p id="FIG_129" class="f150">Fig. 129.</p>

     <p class="center">Left hind shoe with a broad, base-wide<br />
        outer branch for draft-horses that stand<br />
        markedly base-narrow (close behind).</p>
</div>

<p>When uniform setting down of the hoof and uniform wear of the shoe are
desired, every point in the coronary band in the posterior half of the
foot must receive support by the shoe. This applies particularly to the
outer halves of hoofs that are extremely base-narrow. If, for example,
the coronet of the outer quarter projects beyond the plantar border
of the quarter, the outer branch of the shoe from the last nail-hole
back must be kept so wide (full) that an imaginary perpendicular line
dropped from the coronary band will just touch the outer border of the
shoe. The inner branch, on the contrary, should follow the edge of the
wall as closely as possible. Furthermore, the new shoe should be given
more curve,—that is, made wider and fitted more full where the old
shoe shows greatest wear. <i>The principal thought should be to set the
shoe, which should always be regarded as the base of support of the
hoof, farther towards the more strongly worn side.</i> Such a practice
renders superfluous the wide-spread and popular custom of bending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
outward the outer quarter and heel-calk of hind shoes. From the manner
in which a horse travels and the wear of the old shoe, we estimate the
distance that the branches of the shoe should be set from the middle
line of the hoof. If in following out this plan the bearing-surface of
the outer quarter of the wall is not completely covered, the quarter
will be pinched and squeezed inward; this should be prevented by a
broader branch punched so deeply that the holes will fall upon the
white line (<a href="#FIG_129">Fig. 129</a>).</p>

<p>When the shoer has satisfied himself that the shoe fulfils every
requirement and fits perfectly, it is to be cooled, the holes opened
with an oiled pritchel, and the shoe brightened with a file. In filing,
all sharp edges should be removed. If a shoe is to be filed upon the
outer border, to give it a neater appearance, the filing should be done
<i>lengthways of the shoe</i>, and <i>not crossways</i>; of course, the
shoe must not be bent by being improperly clamped in the vise.</p>

<p>It indicates much greater skill in making and fitting shoes when they
look clean and finished with little or no filing.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> In the preceding remarks I have insisted upon a
horizontal bearing-surface for all shoes, with the single exception of
shoes provided with the rolled toe (rolling motion). As far as I can
judge from the literature of shoeing, and from what I have seen with
my own eyes in many countries, this is the most wide-spread practice.
In Germany, on the other hand, there is another method, followed
in the military shoeing shops, <i>which consists in placing the
bearing-surface of the shoe as nearly as possible at right angles to
the slant of the wall</i>. According to this method the bearing-surface
of the shoe, depending upon the direction of the wall (viewed from in
front, from behind, and from the side), should incline more or less,
now backward, now inward, now horizontal, and now outward. Shoes for
wide hoofs are given a bearing-surface which inclines inward, while for
narrow hoofs the shoes have a horizontal bearing-surface. Shoes for wry
hoofs have a bearing-surface which inclines downward and inward for the
slanting wall, and for the steeper wall a horizontal bearing-surface,
which towards the end of the branch may incline slightly downward and
outward. Besides, the bearing-surface of the ends of the branches,
viewed from the side, has a backward and downward inclination. This
method is practicable <b>only in part</b>.

<h4 id="III_I">I. Nailing the Shoe.</h4>

<p>This is that act of horseshoeing by which the shoe is fastened to the
hoof by special nails called hoof-nails or horseshoe-nails, which are
driven through the shoe and horny wall.</p>

<p>At present there are hand-made and machine-made horseshoe-nails. Both
kinds should be made of the best wrought iron. The nails must be
slender, wedge-shaped, and twice as wide as they are thick. Thickness
and length must be in proper relation to each other. We should never
choose a nail which is longer than is absolutely necessary to hold the
shoe; six to eight sizes are sufficient for all purposes.</p>

<p>The rough nails (hand-made), before being used, must undergo a
special shaping to prepare them to pass through the wall easily and
in the desired direction. This preparation is called <i>shaping and
bevelling</i>. In doing this we should see to it that the nails are
made smooth, and even, but are not hammered harder than is absolutely
necessary, because the lighter one can hammer the nails the better they
will be.</p>

<div id="FIG_130" class="figleft">
  <p class="f150"><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span></p>

     <p class="center">Hand-made<br /> horseshoe-nails,<br />
        natural size,<br /> for fullered shoes<br />
        (1, not bevelled).</p>
</div>

<p>Furthermore, we must give the nail that form which will insure its
passing through the horn <i>straight</i> and <i>not in a curve</i>;
with this object in view, the nail is to be slightly curved so that
the side which is turned towards the frog in driving (inside) will be
a little concave, the opposite side convex (<a href="#FIG_130">Figs. 130</a>,
<a href="#FIG_3">3</a>, and <a href="#FIG_131">131, No. 10</a>),
since it is known that a straight nail always passes through the
horn in a curve, and not only does not long remain tight, but is quite
likely to <i>press upon and injure the soft tissues</i> of the foot.
(<a href="#VIII_1">See also, Nailing</a>.)</p>

<p>At the point of the nail the <i>bevel</i> is to be so placed that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
will form a short one-sided wedge with the slanting side directed
<b>from within to without</b> (<a href="#FIG_130">Figs. 130, 3</a>,
and <a href="#FIG_131">131, <i>d</i></a>). A short bevel is suitable
for nails that are to be driven low, while a long bevel makes it
possible to drive them high. <i>The bevel should never form a hook; it
must always be straight, should be sharp but not thin, and under no
conditions incomplete</i> (defective).</p>

<div id="FIG_131" class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Machine-made nails, smooth, polished, bevelled, and ready for use, are,
for many reasons, to be preferred to hand-made nails, though the latter
are rather tougher (<a href="#FIG_131">see Fig. 131</a>).</p>

<p>Before the shoe is nailed on it should be cooled and again carefully
examined by a competent shoer, who should then place it upon the hoof,
where it should be critically observed to see whether it really fulfils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
every requirement of a properly-fitting shoe. Afterwards, the least
fault or defect must be remedied, and then the work of <i>nailing</i>
it begins. By nailing, the shoe is firmly and durably fastened to the
hoof, in doing which the horn of the wall is spared so far as possible,
the elasticity of the hoof borne always in mind, and wounding of the
pododerm entirely avoided. <b>The nails must in all cases penetrate the
white line</b> and pass through the wall in such a straight direction
that they will appear neither too high nor too low upon its outer
surface. In the first case there is considerable danger of pricking or
close-nailing, and in the latter the nail-holes will tear out easily
when the nails are being clinched.</p>

<div id="FIG_132" class="figleft">

  <img  src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="287" />
     <p class="center">Driving<br /> hammer.</p>
</div>

<p>In driving a nail, it should be held in the fingers as long as possible
in the direction in which it is desired that it shall pass through
the horn. A nail should be driven cautiously, with attention to its
<i>sinking and sound</i>, and yet with enough force so that at each
stroke it will penetrate from one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch. The
power required at each stroke will depend upon the hardness of the horn
and the size of the nail. Fearless driving and timorous tapping should
not be allowed.</p>

<p>Nails, which at a depth of five-eighths of an inch are still going
soft, or which bend and give a dull sound, or cause pain, should be
immediately withdrawn.</p>

<p>According to the size of the horse and his hoofs the nails should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
driven from five-eighths to an inch and five-eighths high, and as
<i>even</i> as possible. As soon as a nail is driven its point should
be <b>immediately</b> bent down towards the shoe in order to prevent
injuries. The heads of all the nails should then be gone over with a
hammer and driven down solidly into the nail-holes, the hoof being
meanwhile supported in the left hand. Pincers are then held under the
bent nails and they are more sharply bent by <i>light</i> blows upon
the nail-heads. The points of the nails are now nipped off near the
hoof, the horn which has been thrown out just below the clinches by
bending the nails down is removed with rasp or gouge, and the ends of
the nails bent down still more, but not quite flush with the wall.
This operation is called “clinching.” A clinching-block or a pair of
ordinary blacksmith’s pincers is then placed under the end of the
nail, now called a clinch, and by light blows (in doing this the nail
must not bend within the wall) upon the head the clinch is turned
closer to the surface of the wall; finally, with the front edge of the
nail-hammer the clinch is hammered down flush with the wall. On the
inner half of the wall the clinches should not be felt on stroking the
wall with the fingers. The small amount of horn that projects beyond
the shoe around the toe may be carefully rasped away in the direction
in which the wall slants, but <i>never higher than the clinches</i>;
finally, the sharp lower edge of the wall is to be removed by carrying
the corner of the rasp around between the shoe and the horn.</p>

<p>A clinch is sufficiently long when it equals the width of the nail at
that point.</p>

<p>It is of advantage to use a shoeing-bock or foot-stool in clinching
the nails on the front hoofs. The hind hoofs may be clinched in the
hands. Then the horse should be led out and again moved in order to
see whether or not the new shoeing has actually accomplished what was
desired. Finally, the entire hoof should be given a thin layer of
hoof-salve.

<p><i>Rope Shoes.</i>—These shoes have a groove on the ground-surface, in
which rests a tarred rope, which greatly diminishes slipping on smooth
pavement. For this reason alone they are extensively used in the large
cities of Germany. Since the open rope shoe, when half worn out, will
warp, the bar rope shoe is more satisfactory and more extensively used
(<a href="#FIG_141">Figs. 141-144</a>).

     <p class="center">An open rope shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>Before fitting the shoe the rope must be removed. After the nails are
driven it is laid in the groove and hammered into place. Rope shoes can
seldom be fitted properly to hoofs other than those which are healthy
and of regular shape.</p>

<p><i>Fiber Shoes.</i>—These have a groove on the ground-surface into
which layers of linen fiber belting have been tightly pressed. The
fiber cannot be removed, and therefore the shoes cannot be heated, but
must be fitted cold. The nail-holes are placed between the fiber and
the outer border of the shoe, and are punched too light. The bearing
surface of the shoe is unsupported, so that when the shoe is half worn
out, it warps. There is no distinction between rights and lefts.</p>

<p><i>Rubber shoes</i> have all the defects of fiber shoes, and one
more. The hoof-surface is covered with canvas, which under normal
and acute-angled hoofs wears through under the quarters and leads to
loosening of the last nails.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<h4 id="III_L">L. Rubber Pads.</h4>

<p>The increasing use of asphalt, tarvia and other hard, smooth and
slippery materials for surfacing city streets and country highways has
not only made travelling in flat and even in calked shoes precarious,
but has aggravated all those injuries produced by concussion.</p>

<p>To prevent slipping and the injurious effects of concussion a great
many shoes have been devised, in which are incorporated such materials
as hemp rope, linen fibre, papier maché, cork, wood, bast, felt and
rubber, but all fail in greater or lesser degree to meet practical
requirements.</p>

<p>Rubber, though the most expensive of these materials, is the most
resilient and takes the best grip on smooth pavement. A pad of rubber,
wide enough to cover the branches of the frog alone, or the branches of
the frog and the buttresses of the hoof, firmly cemented to a leather
sole, constitutes the modern rubber pad (<a href="#FIG_145">Figs. 145</a>,
<a href="#FIG_146">146</a>, <a href="#FIG_147">147</a>).</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p><i>A rubber pad should not be used</i>:</p>

<p>1. In contraction of one or both quarters, when the frog is too much
shrunken to bear upon the pad.</p>

<p>2. In lameness from well developed side-bones.</p>

<p>3. In navicular bursitis (“navicular disease”).</p>

<p>4. In thrush, or canker of frog or sole.</p>

<p>Rubber pads, light, medium and heavy, are made in all sizes and are
suitable for all classes of horses, from the light roadster to the
heavy draft type. The short shoe with which they are used reaches the
middle of the quarters. The pad surface (upper surface) of the ends of
the branches should be bevelled to conform to the pad, and to hold it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
firmly against the frog and buttresses. The thickness of the shoe
should equal two-thirds the thickness of the pad, so that when
fitted one-third of the thickness of the pad shall project below the
ground-surface of the shoe. The shoe should be provided with a strong
toe-clip. With the heavy, thick pad of a draft-horse a low toe-calk may
be used, but heel-calks should never be put on a short shoe. Pads are
seldom necessary on the hind feet.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">SHOEING HORSES THAT FORGE AND INTERFERE.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 id="IV_A">A. Forging.</h4>

<p>Forging is that defect of the horse’s gait by reason of which, at a
trot, he strikes the ends of the branches or the under surface of the
front shoe with the toe of the hind shoe or hoof of the same side.
Forging in a pacer is termed “cross-firing” and consists in striking
the inner quarter, or the under surface of the inner branch of a front
shoe with the toe of the diagonal hind shoe or hoof.</p>

<p>Forging is unpleasant to hear and dangerous to the horse. It is liable
to wound the heels of the forefeet, damages the toes or the coronet of
the hind hoofs, and often pulls off the front shoes.</p>

    to prevent “clicking” and the various<br /> injuries due to forging.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—1. Faulty conformation; for example, horses that stand
considerably higher at the croup than at the withers; horses with
long legs and short bodies; horses that “stand under” in front and
behind. 2. Using horses on heavy ground, unskilful driving, allowing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
long-necked, heavy-headed horse to carry his head too low; riding
without holding a horse to his work by feeling his mouth and pressing
the knees against his sides. 3. Fatigue frequently leads to forging,
even in horses that are well built and properly shod. It may also occur
in the act of vaulting over an obstacle. 4. Poor shoeing, especially
too long toes upon the front and hind hoofs, and too long front shoes.</p>

<p>The aim of the shoer should be to facilitate the quick and easy
“breaking over” of the <b>front foot</b>, so that it may get away
before it is overtaken by the hind foot. The toe of the front hoof
should be fairly short and rolled; the quarters spared. The front shoe
should be light, rolled at the toe and <b>no longer and no wider</b>
than the hoof. The ends of the branches of a flat shoe, and also the
heel-calks, in case they are needed to elevate a heel that is too low,
should be bevelled from the hoof-surface of the shoe downward and
forward under the foot. Such short heel-calks, bevelled to prevent
forging, are called “forging calks.” If the horse continues to forge
between the branches and against the ground-surface of the shoe,
concaving this surface will prove advantageous (convex iron). The form
of the front shoes of horses that forge should represent merely a
prolongation of the hoof.</p>

<p>The “breaking over” of the <b>hind foot</b> should be delayed by
sparing the toe and lowering the quarters, but not sufficiently to
break the foot-axis too far backward. The hind shoe is to be squared at
the toe and the lower edge of the shoe in the region of the toe well
rounded; instead of a toe-clip, two side-clips are to be drawn up and
the shoe so fitted that at least three-fourths of the thickness of the
wall of the toe, with the edge well rounded, will extend forward beyond
the shoe. Should the toe of the hoof be short it may be raised either
by a low toe-calk set one-fourth of an inch back from the edge of the
shoe, or by thinning the shoe from the toe to the ends of the branches.
The branches of a flat hind shoe should extend somewhat farther back of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the buttresses than under normal conditions, to trail upon the ground
just before the hoof alights, and acting as a brake, to bring the hoof
to earth (<a href="#FIG_150">Fig. 150</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_150" class="f150">Fig. 150.</p>
   <img src="images/i_140.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="308" />
     <p class="blockquot">Hind shoe with swelled toe to slow the
     breaking over. Often efficient when the hoof is too short
     at the toe: <i>a</i>, long branches to trail and bring the
     foot to earth; <i>b</i>, outer toe clip; <i>c</i>, toe
     squared and set under to prevent injury to front hoof, and
     to deaden the sound of forging.</p>
</div>

<p>“Cross-firing” is most apt to occur and is most dangerous at extreme
speed. Then, when the inner branch of the hind shoe strikes the inner
heel, quarter or shoe of the diagonal front foot, both feet are in the
air,—the fore foot is approaching the middle of its stride, while the
offending hind foot is in the last third of its flight. The standing
position that favors cross-firing is the base-wide (toe-wide) in front,
and the base-narrow (toe-narrow) behind. With this direction of limbs
the flight of the fore feet is forward and inward during the first
half of their stride, while the flight of the hind feet is forward and
inward during the second half of their stride (<a href="#FIG_72">see Figs. 72</a>,
<a href="#FIG_73">73</a>, <a href="#FIG_75">75</a>).</p>

<p>The problem is, therefore, so to pare and shoe a base-wide fore foot
that it will break over nearer the centre of the toe and thus execute
less of an inward swing during the first half of its stride, and to so
pare and shoe a base-narrow hind foot that it will break over nearer
the centre of the toe and thus execute less of an inward swing during
the second half of its stride. Neither a toe-wide nor a toe-narrow
foot can be made to break over the exact centre of the toe, and yet it
is possible by dressing the hoof and by shoeing to shift the breaking
over point nearer to the centre of the toe, and by doing so, to alter
slightly the lines of flight of the feet.</p>

<p>Dressing and shoeing the front foot: <b>The hoof</b> should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
relatively low from the middle of the toe around to and including the
<i>outer</i> buttress. If the inner half of the wall is deficient in
length it must be raised above the outer half by applying a shoe which
is thinner in its outer than in its inner branch. The inner toe should
be left long.</p>

be bevelled base-wide, and the nail-holes punched coarse, <i>i.e.</i>,
far in from the outer border (<a href="#FIG_151">Figs. 151</a> and
<a href="#FIG_152">152</a>). The outer branch may carry a small heel-calk.</p>

<h4 id="IV_B">B. Interfering.</h4>

<p>A horse “interferes” when a hoof in motion strikes the opposite
supporting leg. Interfering is apt to produce injuries, either of the
coronary band of the inner half of the foot or of the fetlock-joint, or
(in fore-limbs) of the cannon, even as high up as the knee. Lameness
frequently accompanies such injuries.</p>

<p><i>The causes of interfering</i> lie either in the <i>shoeing</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
(of the foot that strikes, as well as of the foot which is struck), in
the <i>position of the limbs</i>, or in the <i>use</i> of the animal.
Horses that have the correct standing position do not interfere when
they are properly shod; base-wide horses interfere sometimes; horses
base-narrow down to the fetlock and toe-wide below that point interfere
very frequently. Traces of unequal length, weariness, and shoeing at
too long intervals favor interfering.</p>

<p>In attempting to lessen or remove interfering, the horse must be most
carefully examined with respect to the position of his limbs, his gait,
and his shoeing, in the manner described on pages 90 to 92.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="blockquot">A right front shoe with nailless and
     narrow inner branch for a base-wide hoof. Suitable for
     horses that strike anywhere from inner toe back to the
     quarter.</p>
</div>

<p>If the cause is found to be the twisted position of a shoe, too wide
hoofs, raised clinches, etc., nothing need be done further than to
correct the shoeing; but if a faulty position of the limbs is the
cause, we must ascertain the exact part of the hoof that does the
striking, diminish the size of the hoof at that point, regulate the
entire plantar surface of the hoof, make the shoe straight along
the region that strikes,—that is, without curve,—and so fit it to
the foot that one-third of the thickness of the wall will extend
beyond the shoe. Where interfering is so pronounced as to produce
serious injuries, we use a shoe with no nails in the inner branch
(“dropped-crease” shoe) (<a href="#FIG_153">Figs. 153</a>,
<a href="#FIG_156">156</a>, <a href="#FIG_157">157</a>).

</div>

<p>The so-called <i>interfering shoes</i> (<a href="#FIG_154">Figs. 154</a>
and <a href="#FIG_155">155</a>) are worthy of recommendation only
for hoofs of the base-narrow position. The interfering branch, whose
greater thickness raises the inner wall, which is often too low, is
to be so shaped and directed that the hoof will project somewhat
beyond it. <i>This interfering branch must be made and shaped in
accordance with each individual case.</i> The holes in the interfering
branch should be punched somewhat finer (nearer the edge) than usual.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Interfering shoes in which the nail-holes, with the exception of
the inner toe nail-hole, are placed in the outer branch, are called
“<i>dropped-crease interfering shoes</i>” (<a href="#FIG_156">Fig. 156</a>).
Such shoes are not recommended for hind hoofs that are decidedly toe-wide
(toe-cutters); in such cases better results will be obtained by using
a shoe, either with or without heel-calks, whose inner branch is
straight and without nails along the striking region, and is fitted
wide (full) at the quarter. The inner branch should be from one-fourth
to three-eighths of an inch longer than the outer. The inner heel-calk
should be higher than the outer, and the end of the outer branch should
be as base-narrow as it can be made (fitted close) (<a href="#FIG_157">Fig. 157</a>).
In order to prevent shifting of an interfering shoe, a side-clip should be drawn
up on the outer branch (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>There is no manner of shoeing that will prevent interfering which is
caused by improper harnessing, crooked hitching, or weariness. The
simpler and the <i>lighter</i> the shoes the less will horses interfere.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">WINTER SHOEING.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>All shoes whose ground-surface is provided with contrivances to prevent
slipping upon snow and ice are called winter shoes.</p>

<div id="FIG_158" class="figleft">
  <p class="f120">Fig. 158.</p>
  <img  src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="268" />
     <p class="center">An ice-nail,<br /> frost-nail.</p>
</div>

<p>These various contrivances are produced by several processes called
“methods of sharpening.” All methods may be gathered into two
groups,—namely, <i>practical</i> sharp-shoeing and <i>impractical</i>.
Only the first will be considered.</p>

<p>The durability of sharpened shoes depends partly upon whether they
are made of steel or iron, and partly upon the nature of the ground
in winter. If the ground is continuously covered with a thick layer
of snow, whatever method of sharpening is followed, the shoes <b>stay
sharp</b>; if, however, the winter is open, changeable, with more bare
ice than snow, no method of sharpening, whatever it may be, will last
long; the shoes will <b>not stay sharp</b>.</p>

<p>For these reasons no method of sharpening which fulfils all conditions
satisfactorily has yet been discovered.</p>

<p id="V_1">The simplest and at the same time the least durable method
of sharpening is: 1. That by means of <b>ice-nails</b> or
<b>frost-nails</b> (<a href="#FIG_158">Fig. 158</a>). One or two nails
are drawn from each branch of the shoe and replaced with ice-nails.</p>

<p id="V_2">2. <b>Sharp Toe- and Heel-Calks.</b>—The outer calk is split
and a small steel wedge welded in. It is then laid upon the edge of the
anvil, indented and sharpened from within to without in such a manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
that the calk shall be thin from the branch to the ground, and the
outer surface shall be in the same vertical plane as the outer edge. If
a calk is narrow from its base to its end, and at the same time without
flaw, it does not need a sharp cutting edge. The inner calk should
never be sharpened except the ground be very slippery. The cutting edge
of this inner calk stands at right angles to the length of the branch,
and its outer corner should then be rounded to prevent its injuring the
opposite foot (<a href="#FIG_159">Figs. 159</a>, <a href="#FIG_160">160</a>).</p>

     <p class="center">Outer and inner heel-calks sharpened.</p>
</div>

<p>For horses used for heavy draft purposes a toe-calk is welded to the
shoe and sharpened. For this purpose we use only steel (toe-steel),
which is easily welded to the shoe and remains firm. Toe-calks and
steeled heel-calks are tempered, in order, as much as possible, to
lengthen their period of durability. This method of sharpening is the
oldest and most wide-spread, and is employed on the shoes of all horses
of which we require more than light service.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     heel-calk, half sharp and directed transversely to
     direction of the branch.</p>
</div>

<p>Hoofs are easily damaged or even ruined by frequently repeated
sharpening of the shoes, because every time this is done the shoes must
be removed and replaced.

<p id="V_3">3. <b>Shoeing with Screw Heel-Calks.</b>—Any ordinary flat shoe not
too thin and narrow at the ends of the branches can be changed to
a shoe with screw heel-calks by punching holes in the ends of the
branches and cutting a thread in them.</p>

<div id="FIG_162" class="figleft">
  <p class="f120">Fig. 162.</p>
  <img  src="images/i_148.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="363" />
     <p class="center">Ground-surface of the end of<br />
              a branch of shoe, showing (<i>a</i>)<br />
              hole and counter-sinking<br />
              for a screw-calk<br />
              (one-half natural size).</p>
</div>

<p>The screw heel-calk holes are made either by punching or boring. The
punching is done by means of an almost cylindrical hammer-punch,
afterwards finishing the holes by driving through them a round punch
which tapers from the middle towards both ends. On the ground-surface
of the shoe the hole is moderately counter-sunk (<a href="#FIG_162">Fig. 162, <i>a</i></a>),
so that after the thread has been cut and the calk screwed into place
the shoulder of the latter will rest on the counter-sinking.</p>

<p>At present nearly all screw-calks are made by machinery, either of iron
or toe-steel. The former is too soft and therefore not sufficiently
durable; the latter, however, is quite durable when the calk is
properly hardened (tempered) by heating to a cherry-red, sticking
the head of the calk as far as the tap into a bed of moist sand, and
allowing it to slowly cool.</p>

<p>The chief requirements of a good screw-calk are, further, a <b>clean,
deep</b>, but not too coarse <b>thread</b>, and but <i>one size of
thread and tap for all calks</i>, so that every calk will fit in every
shoe. A calk whose tap measures one half-inch (12.7 millimetres)
(Whitworth) in diameter is sufficient for the heaviest shoes. The tap
which is used to cut the thread in the holes for the screw-calks must
be about ¹/₁₂₅ of an inch thicker than the head of the calk. In the
German army the calks have a tap fifteen thirty-seconds of an inch in
diameter. The coachman should be given four calks (sharp and blunt) for
each shoe, and a small screw-calk key for placing and removing them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Screw toe-calks are also used, yet they require special security to
prevent their becoming loose. Experimentation with the screw toe-calks,
though not yet entirely satisfactory, cannot be said to have ended.</p>

<p>The advantages of shoes provided with good screw heel-calks are so
manifold that they deserve marked preference over shoes sharpened
by the ordinary methods. The common objections urged against
screw-calks,—namely, that they loosen and are lost, or break off, are
not worthy of serious consideration, since these evils are merely the
result of unskilful workmanship and poor material. <i>Shoes with screw
heel-calks are the best shoes for winter, especially for horses that
have to work hard and continuously.</i></p>

<p>Balling with snow is prevented by using shoes narrow in the web and
concave upon the ground-surface (convex iron), and thoroughly oiling
the sole and frog. Sole-pads of felt, leather, or straw serve the
same purpose. Balling with snow is <i>best</i> prevented by a rubber
sole-and-frog pad, or by a “stopping” of a patent hoof cement known in
Germany as “huflederkitt.”

calk-holes, hence their name. Round and square peg-calks are used, but
the former are better than the latter.</p>

<p>The inventor of round peg-calks is Judson, an American. The shoes
differ in no respect from the ordinary flat shoes. It is necessary that
the tap of the calk have a moderately conical form, and exactly fit
into the calk-hole of the shoe. The taper of the calk-tap is correct
if for every ten thirty-seconds of an inch in length it increases or
diminishes one-thirty-second of an inch in diameter (equal to one inch

<p>Although the calk-holes may be punched in a hot shoe, yet boring and
reaming them is much better, because by this method a more perfect fit
can be secured. For this purpose we require a drill (a spiral drill is
the best) whose diameter is exactly the same as that of the small end
of the calk-tap (<a href="#FIG_165">Figs. 165, <i>c</i></a>,
and <a href="#FIG_166">166, <i>c</i></a>). After the
shoe has been fitted to the hoof, the provisional holes are drilled
and afterwards reamed out from the ground-surface of the shoe with
the reamer shown in <a href="#FIG_167">Fig. 167</a>. Since the tap of the reamer
corresponds exactly in size to the tap of the calk, it is evident that the latter
must exactly fit and be tight. The wire edge that is raised around the
hole is removed with a file, and the edge then smoothed by introducing
the reamer a second time. The calks are made of rolled round steel,
which has the thickness of the tap-end of the calk. For this purpose
we require a calk-mould or matrix, in which one or more holes have
been finished with a reamer. A piece of rod steel is heated at the end
for a distance nearly twice the length of the calk, is swaged, thrust
into the matrix, then broken off, and back-set. This will give a blunt
peg-calk. If a sharp calk is desired, the upper part of the head of the
calk is sharpened in the ordinary manner, although this is accomplished
most easily by using a pair of tongs with short jaws that are hollowed
upon the inside for seizing the tap of the calk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Before the shoes are nailed on, the normal punch should be oiled and
driven into the calk-holes, and the calks passed into the holes to see
that they fit perfectly.</p>

<p>The calks are driven into place <b>after</b> the shoes are nailed to
the hoofs. A light blow is sufficient to fasten a calk, yet a necessary
precaution is first to remove every trace of oil from the calks and
calk-holes. The first calk driven into place must be held with the hand
while the second is being driven, otherwise it will either spring from
the calk-hole or be loosened so that it will soon afterwards be lost.</p>

<p>To remove such a calk we strike its head from different sides with a
hammer, stone, or other hard object until it becomes loose, when a
rather hard blow upon the shoe causes it to spring out. Calks which
have worn down are seized by a pair of sharp nippers and loosened by
blows upon the shoe. Since a calk which is firm soon rusts and is then
very difficult to remove, it is recommended that all calks be removed
every night.</p>

<p>The <b>advantages</b> of peg-calks over screw-calks are: 1. They do not
break off. 2. They are easier to make and simpler to use. 3. They are
<b>cheaper</b>.</p>

<p><b>Disadvantages.</b>—1. Peg-calks are sometimes lost, even when
properly made and most carefully introduced. This evil happens much
less frequently when the calks are put in by the maker (horseshoer)
than when they are stuck in by the coachman, attendant, rider, or other
person. When calks are lost on the way from the shop, it is usually due
to some fault in the calk-holes or in the calks, although when the feet
are balled with snow the calks are easily lost, because they do not
then touch the ground.</p>

<p>2. The removal of the calks often involves many difficulties, since
they are apt to rust into place if not removed daily, and when worn
down so far that they cannot be grasped with the pincers are almost
impossible to remove. By hammering upon the calks and shoe many horses
are rendered not only restive, but sensitive in the feet.</p>

<p>3. If horses are used without the calks, a wire edge forms around the
hole on the bottom of the shoe, which interferes with the placing of
the calk and lessens its security.</p>

<p>The <b>hollow peg-calk</b> (<a href="#FIG_168">Fig. 168</a>), made by
Branscheid &amp; Philippi, of Remscheid, has considerable merit.
It holds exceedingly well, and is very durable. It is furnished in
three sizes,—Nos. 12, 13, and 14,—of twenty-seven, thirty-one, and
thirty-four millimetres length, and twelve, thirteen, and fourteen
millimetres diameter at the end of the tap.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>A punch is furnished which, when driven up to its head in the holes of
the heated shoe, insures a proper width and shape of the hole and an
accurately fitting calk.</p>

<p>The calks may be removed by an extractor (<a href="#FIG_169">Fig. 169</a>)
having at one end a thread which is screwed into a corresponding thread
on the inside of the hollow calk, when by a few hammer blows on the
shoe the calk loosens. To prevent the calk becoming choked with dirt,
a piece of cork is thrust into the hollow. It may be easily removed by
means of the corkscrew at the other end of the extractor.</p>

<p id="V_5">5. <b>Shoeing with Peg Toe-Calks.</b>—These are an invention of
considerable worth, especially for heavy draft in hilly country. They
render better service on hind than on front shoes.</p>

<p>Peg toe-calks with a single tap are simpler and preferable to those
with two taps. Every known contrivance to prevent the occasional loss
of the peg toe-calk is impractical.</p>

<p>The shoe for a peg toe-calk should be of good tough material and
without a flaw. The toe of the shoe should be about one-twelfth to
one-tenth of an inch thicker than the branches.</p>

<p>The hole for the peg toe-calk, whatsoever its shape may be, must be
smooth and uniform, with clean, true corners. Semi-circular holes
should present the convex side towards the toe.</p>

<p>Before punching, draw up the toe-clip. A punch-plate with a good-sized
hole, and a tap which will fit into the square hole in the anvil will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
facilitate the work. The punch-plate when in position should be flush
with the front edge of the anvil. Place the toe of the shoe, hoof
surface upward, over the hole of the punch-plate, and drive a hole with
a punch-hammer which is perceptibly thinner than the model punch. Now
turn the shoe over, punch back from the ground-surface, and then file
away the wire edge which the punch has raised on the ground-surface.
Next, take a hand-punch, the end of which should just enter the hole,
punch through from the ground-surface, and correct any bulging by
dressing lightly over the horn of the anvil. Finally, use the model
punch to give the hole the exact size and smoothness.</p>

<p>Should the hole in the toe of the shoe enlarge in time, as sometimes
occurs, then back-set when necessary on removing the shoe. Backsetting
is easiest with the half-round hole, because the curved side, being
turned forward, runs approximately parallel to the outer border of the
toe of the shoe.</p>

<p>A good serviceable peg toe-calk must possess the following characteristics:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The tap must be of such shape as not to turn; therefore, not
round.</p>

<p>2. The tap must be cone-shaped, and diminish in diameter about
one-thirty-second of an inch for each one-fourth of an inch of its
length from base to apex. If the tap has less taper it will enlarge the
hole in the shoe till the head of the calk comes into contact with the
shoe, when the calk will loosen and drop out.</p>

<p>3. The tap must be full-formed and smooth.</p>

<p>4. It must fit air-tight in the toe, and a single <span
class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> hammer-blow should be
sufficient to fix it securely.</p>

<p>5. The <b>head</b> of the toe-calk <b>must not rest on the shoe</b>;
a space of one-sixteenth of an inch should intervene.</p>
</div>

<p>While a shoer of average mechanical ability can make a faultless peg
toe-calk, it is not profitable to do so while good machine-made calks
are to be had very cheap.</p>

<p id="V_6">6. <b>Removable Heel-Calks that do not Require Sharpening.</b>—The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
undeniable fact that all chisel-shaped or pyramid-shaped sharp calks
become dull in time, and must then either be sharpened or replaced by
new calks, renders shoeing not only costly, but injurious to the hoofs
and annoying to the owner. This drawback is most pronounced in large
cities, where the snow never lies long upon the streets, and the horse
just sharp-shod is soon obliged to travel upon bare pavements. Attempts
have been made to lessen this annoyance by the use of calks that do
<i>not require sharpening</i>, and yet which will prevent slipping
even after they have been used for a long time upon bare pavements.
It cannot be denied that such calks have considerable value, and,
except when the ground is covered with ice, many of these calks render
excellent service. Just as the ordinary sharp calks are satisfactory
and very durable outside of the large cities, so now for the first
time a few of these recently invented sharp calks seem to be worthy of
recommendation for city use. The following are the best:</p>

There is no doubt that the grip that these calks take upon the ground
and their durability depend upon the diameter and the arrangement of
their surfaces of friction. From all experiments made thus far it is
shown that those calks which have narrow and comparatively few surfaces
of friction are the least durable.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">HOOF NURTURE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Hoof nurture comprises all those measures which are employed to keep
hoofs healthy, elastic, and serviceable.</p>

<h4 id="VI_A">A. Care of Unshod Hoofs.</h4>

<p>The care of the hoofs of colts is of special importance. <i>Abundant
exercise</i> upon dry ground which is not too stony is most beneficial.
Such exercise will cause the hoofs to wear gradually, and it will only
be necessary from time to time to observe whether the wear is taking
place uniformly, and if not, to correct the uneven wear with the rasp.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_183" class="f150">Fig. 183.</p>
   <img src="images/i_157.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="183" />
     <p class="blockquot">Twisted left front long pastern of
     colt, viewed from the upper articular surface. The lower
     end has been twisted toward the left: <i>a</i>, transverse
     axis of lower articular surface; <i>b</i>, transverse axis
     of the upper articular surface.</p>
</div>

<p>If colts are reared in the stable, the horn continuing to grow down
does not undergo sufficient wear, and changes in form of the hoof,
and even permanent distortions of the bones of the foot gradually
occur. The wall becomes too long and bends or sometimes separates from
the sole and keraphyllous layer. Weak quarters bend (curl) inward
and encroach upon the space occupied by the frog (contracted feet of
colts). The toe becomes too long, and this gives rise to too steep a
position of the pastern and causes an insecure and diffident gait;
therefore the hoofs must be shortened from time to time. The in-curved
quarters should be removed with the hoof-knife, and the outer edge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the plantar border of the wall well rounded with the rasp. In the
base-wide and base-narrow standing positions the outer and inner walls
respectively become relatively long and induce the colt to assume a
still more abnormal position. The young and pliant pasterns may thus
become permanently twisted and distorted (<a href="#FIG_183">see Figs. 183</a>
and <a href="#FIG_184">184</a>). In a hoof that is becoming awry,
restoring to the wall its proper level with relation to the position
of the limb will not only be invaluable in ultimately producing a good
hoof, but will improve the faulty position of the limb. In exceptional
cases, where the plantar border of some section of the wall gives
evidence of too rapid wear, the application of a tip or of a half-shoe
may be of benefit. Furthermore, we should attempt to secure greater
cleanliness by frequently and thoroughly washing the hoofs and bedding
with plenty of good straw.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     showing compression shortening of outer half: <i>a</i>,

</div>

<p>Too early shoeing of young horses is very injurious; it hinders the
development of the hoofs, and, furthermore, young horses when shod are
frequently seriously overworked and prematurely ruined. Moderate work
in the fields does not injure young horses, but for such service they
do not require shoes.</p>

<p>The unshod hoofs of older horses should be periodically rounded with a
rasp and the length of the walls regulated when, by reason of a lack of
exercise, proper wear has not taken place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<h4 id="VI_B">B. Care of Shod Hoofs.</h4>

<p>Shod hoofs are exposed to many more injuries than are unshod hoofs,
because shoeing itself, although absolutely necessary to render horses
continuously serviceable upon hard streets, is injurious to the hoof,
since it to a greater or less extent prevents the physiological
movements of the different parts of the foot, interferes with the
circulation of the blood in the foot, slows the growth of the horn, and
brings about a gradual shrinking of the entire hoof.</p>

<p>In addition, there are the injurious consequences of stabulation. These
are <i>prevention of free movement</i>, <i>uncleanliness</i> due to
bad floors and filthy bedding,—as, for example, peat moss and soiled
straw,—and <i>dryness</i>.</p>

<p>Continuous standing always contributes to contraction of the hoofs,
and this evil is greatly favored by dryness, which more particularly
affects the front hoofs. The hind hoofs receive sufficient moisture
from the animal’s manure. Poor floors, particularly those that are
uneven, tire the limbs. Accumulation of manure and the <i>careless</i>
use of stationary sole-pads induce thrush of the frog.</p>

<p id="VI_B_A">The object of hoof nurture is to lessen or entirely remove all these
injurious consequences of shoeing and stabulation. It comprises,
therefore, not only the proper shortening of the hoofs every five to
six weeks, but careful attention to <i>cleanliness and moisture</i>.
Both are insured by dry straw and daily picking out and washing the
hoofs. Such measures will prevent thrush in the hind feet. If front
hoofs are washed once a day, sufficient moisture will penetrate
the horn to give it that degree of suppleness (elasticity) which
is possessed by an unshod hoof, and which contributes to a proper
expansion of the hoof when the body-weight is placed upon it. <i>In
order to prevent a hoof from again drying out</i>, the entire
hoof should receive a thorough application of an oil or ointment
(hoof-salve). <i>The object of greasing the horn is to prevent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
evaporation of the moisture that has penetrated the horn.</i> Specially
compounded hoof-salves are not necessary. Melted horse-grease,
pork-fat, or any other fat that is not rancid is sufficient. Cosmoline
is an excellent hoof-salve.</p>

<p><i>Abundant</i> but not excessive <i>exercise</i> is more necessary
than anything else to the preservation of the health of the hoof. It
aids the circulation of blood within the foot, and, therefore, the
growth of the horn. Horses which perform hard, regular work have, as
a rule, better hoofs than those which stand the greater part of the
time in the stable. Poulticing hoofs with clay, bran, linseed-meal,
or white-rock, or standing them in water is unnecessary if they have
had proper care, but will sometimes be of benefit when the hoofs have
been neglected, and especially so for front hoofs. The latter are more
exposed to drying influences, and the shoes prevent the moistening
process by keeping the hoofs partially or completely removed from
contact with the earth. <i>Oiling alone is not sufficient to soften
horn</i>, but must always be preceded by permeation of the horn with
water. <b>Oiling without first cleansing the hoof is useless, because
this soon produces a greasy crust underneath which the horn is crisp
and brittle.</b></p>

<p>The surest sign of cleanliness of a hoof is the appearance of the
natural color of the horn, the latter appearing translucent even after
the hoof-ointment has been applied; therefore, blackened hoof-ointments
should not be used. When hoofs are exposed to too much moisture (muddy
roads, melting snow, etc.) an addition of wax or common yellow rosin to
the hoof-ointment is recommended to prevent too great softening of the
horn. <i>No hoof-ointment has any direct influence upon the growth of
the horn.</i></p>

<p>Inasmuch as it is a fact that the very best shoeing injures the hoof,
it is advisable to allow horses to go barefoot whenever it is possible.
This applies especially to horses that from any cause are thrown out
of service, presupposing, of course, that the nature of the hoofs will
allow them to go barefoot.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">GENERAL REMARKS CONCERNING THE SHOEING<br />
           OF DEFECTIVE HOOFS AND LAME HORSES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The boundary between health and disease of the hoof is difficult to
determine, especially when we have to deal with minor defects of
structure or shape of the hoof. Ordinarily, we first consider a hoof
diseased when it causes lameness. However, we know that diseases of the
hoof may exist without lameness. Therefore, a hoof should be regarded
as diseased or defective when the nature of the horn, the form of the
hoof, or the parts enclosed by it, deviate from what we consider as
normal or healthy (<a href="#Page_81">see page 81</a>), whether the
service of the animal is influenced by it or not.</p>

<p>Front hoofs become diseased or defective more readily than hind
hoofs, because they bear greater weight, have more slanting walls,
and are more exposed to drying influences. <b>All normally wry hoofs
and acute-angled hoofs become more readily diseased than regular and
upright (stumpy) hoofs.</b></p>

<p>The <i>indications</i> of the various diseases of the hoof are
discussed in the following chapters. We shall in this chapter undertake
only a brief general discussion of <i>inflammation of the pododerm</i>.
This inflammation, known as <b>pododermatitis</b>, always manifests
itself by <i>lameness</i> and, under closer examination of the foot,
by <i>increased warmth</i>, <i>pain</i>, and <i>stronger pulsation
of the digital</i> and <i>plantar arteries</i>. The pain produces
either a <i>timid, shortened</i> (sore) <i>gait</i>, or well-marked
<i>lameness</i>, especially upon <i>hard</i> ground. Increased
sensitiveness of the pododerm is detected by compression of the hoof
with the pincers (hoof-testers), or with greater certainty by lightly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
tapping the hoof. The increased warmth of a part or of the entire
hoof is detected by feeling with the hand. Intense pain and greatly
increased warmth, with a moderate, diffuse swelling of the soft parts
between the hoof and fetlock-joint, indicate suppuration within the hoof.</p>

<p><i>The examination</i> of horses lame in the feet must always be
cautious and searching, and should begin with the moving and judging
of the horse as already described on page 90. The faults detected in
the hoof or in the shoeing, the pain and increased warmth of the hoof,
will not leave us in doubt as to whether the animal is lame in the hoof
or not. However, should there be a doubt, we must carefully examine
all the joints and tendons of the foot and, if necessary, of the limb
above, and observe the animal’s manner of travelling at a walk and at a
trot, on soft and on hard ground, in a straight line and in a circle.</p>

<p>The <b>removal of the shoe</b> should be performed with <b>greatest
caution</b>. Under certain conditions the second shoe should not be
removed until the first has been replaced. The same caution must be
observed in paring the hoof, which is to be regarded as a part of
the examination of the hoof. The paring of a hoof for this purpose
often differs somewhat from the preparation of a sound hoof for the
shoe, and while it is necessary because it frequently furnishes the
first trustworthy indication of the trouble, it must be done with
circumspection and intelligence.</p>

<p>The <i>causes</i> of diseases of the hoof are very numerous, for many
external influences act injuriously upon the hoof. In addition to
too great dryness, want of care (neglected shoeing), and premature,
unreasonable, cruel use of the horse, should be mentioned particularly
<i>injudicious dressing of the hoof and direct and indirect faults in
the shoeing</i>. The pododerm, shut in between the hard os pedis and
the stiff, unyielding horn capsule, is frequently exposed to bruising
and other injuries, from which arise most of the defects of the hoof
itself. All these things lead, under certain conditions, to lameness.

</div>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—First of all, the discovered causes should be
removed, or, if this is not possible, as is frequently the case, they
should be ameliorated. Very often the lameness may be removed by proper
shoeing, a change in the animal’s work, and better care of the hoof.
When there is intense inflammation within the foot, the shoe should be
removed for a few days. When the inflammation is moderate and confined
to a small area, it is usually sufficient to alter the shoeing by
regulating unnatural relations of height in the different parts of the
wall, and by removing all superfluous horn from the wall and sole (to
a less degree from the frog), partly for the purpose of rendering the
horn capsule more yielding, and partly to make the poultices which
are used more effective. The shoe is then to be so applied that the
diseased region will be <i>relieved of the body-weight</i>, and will
remain free from all pressure from the shoe. This can be done partly
by making the underlying branch of the shoe somewhat wider and longer
than the other, and partly by cutting down the bearing-edge of the
wall where this is possible without weakening it too much, otherwise
by concaving or beating down the upper surface of the shoe. By reason
of the fact that the posterior half of the hoof is the seat of most
diseases of the hoof, it is to be recommended that the nail-holes
in shoes used in these diseases be placed as far as possible in the
anterior half of the shoe, and in some special cases distributed evenly
around the toe. Among shoes suitable for diseased hoofs the bar-shoe
(<a href="#FIG_185">Fig. 185</a>) holds the first place, because it renders superfluous
many other shoes specially designed for various diseases of the hoof. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
made like an ordinary flat shoe, except that it requires a somewhat
longer piece of iron; the ends of the branches are bent inward over a
dull corner of the anvil, bevelled, laid one over the other, and welded
together to form the bar. The width and thickness of the bar should be
the same as of the rest of the shoe, and its frog-surface should be
slightly concave.</p>

<p>The <i>bar-shoe is valuable, because</i> it protects from pressure
diseased sections of the wall which have been laid free, allows part of
the body-weight to be borne by the frog, and restores normal activity
to the disturbed physiological movements of the foot. By using it we
can either gain a more extensive bearing-surface for the hoof, or can
make it easier for the surface that bears the weight to do the work. If
on account of <i>weakness</i> of the bearing-surface of the hoof, or
from any other cause, we wish to distribute the body-weight over the
entire plantar surface of the foot with the exception of the painful
region, we add a <i>leather sole</i> to the bar-shoe.</p>

<p>In this case it is necessary to place holes in the ends of the branches
of the shoe, so that we may rivet the leather firmly to the shoe with
small nails. The shoe should be made somewhat wider than the hoof,
and the clips somewhat higher than usual. After fitting the shoe the
grooves for the clips are cut in the leather, the latter is riveted
to the shoe, and all leather projecting beyond the outer edge of the
shoe is trimmed away. The lacunæ of the frog and other concavities of
the sole are then thickly smeared with wood-tar and afterwards filled
up with oakum to such a degree that the packing will bear some of
the body-weight when the shoe and leather sole are in position. This
packing is of great importance, because it prevents the filtering in
from behind of sand and slime, preserves the toughness and pliability
of the horn, breaks shock, and produces a gradual expansion of the
posterior half of the hoof. Before nailing the shoe to the foot the
leather sole should be soaked in water.

<span class="h_subtitle">INFLAMMATIONS OF THE PODODERM<br  /> (PODODERMATITIS).</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 id="VIII_1">1. Nailing.</h4>

<p>Wounds of the velvety tissue of the sole or of the podophyllous tissue
of the wall, caused by nails which have been driven into the hoof for
the purpose of fastening the shoe, are usually termed “nailing.”</p>

<p>We distinguish <i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i> nailing; the former is
noticed <i>immediately</i>, the latter <i>later</i>.</p>

<p>In <b>direct</b> nailing the nail passes directly into the pododerm
(velvety tissue of the sole, podophyllous tissue); the wound produced
may vary from a simple puncture of the pododerm to chipping of the
border of the os pedis, and is <b>always accompanied by bleeding</b>,
even though it may not always be noticed.</p>

<p>In <b>indirect</b> nailing the nail does not pass entirely through the
horn capsule, but very close to the sensitive tissues, and crowds the
soft horn inward against them. This inward bulging presses upon the
pododerm and causes inflammation and lameness, which may not manifest
themselves for several days.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>—The first symptom of direct nailing is <b>instant
pain</b> indicated by flinching or a jerking of the limb, showing that
the nail has taken a wrong course, and then a more or less profuse
hemorrhage. Usually the blood flows from the nail-hole, or the nail
when withdrawn may merely show a bloodstain at its point; however,
internal bleeding may occur without any external manifestations. The
symptoms of indirect nailing are entirely different. In this case
<i>pain does not arise immediately</i>, but later, sometimes as soon as
the horse attempts to bear his weight upon the shod foot. In the latter
case, on holding up the opposite foot the animal sways backward and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
throws his weight upon the holder, or becomes restless. As a rule,
the consequences of indirect nailing are first manifested after two
or three days, infrequently from the eighth to the fourteenth day, as
inflammation within the hoof and lameness, at which time a careful
examination will usually reveal increased warmth of the hoof, pain
upon pressure with the hoof-testers and on tapping the hoof lightly,
some swelling of the entire foot, increased pulsation of the digital
arteries, and unwillingness of the animal to place all or perhaps any
of its weight upon the foot.</p>

<p><i>Suspicion of nailing</i> should be entertained if the shoeing be
recent, the hoof appear too small in relation to the body-weight, the
walls have been thinned by rasping or have been broken away, or if the
nails have been driven too high or very irregularly.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—The most common causes are mistakes in shoeing. In
the majority of cases the cause is a disregard of the rule that the
<b>nails should penetrate the white line</b> (<a href="#Page_118">see pages 118</a>,
<a href="#Page_119">119</a> and <a href="#Page_130">130</a>,
heavy type). 1, using badly-punched shoes; 2, excessive paring and
shortening of the hoof; 3, weakening of the lower border of the wall by
excessive rasping away of the outside (<a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187, <i>c</i></a>);
4, mistakes in fitting the shoe, especially applying shoes that are too narrow,
letting the toe-clips too deep into the horn, by which the nail-holes
near the toe, instead of falling upon the white line, are carried back
upon the edge of the sole, or using shoes in which the nail-holes
are too wide or improperly directed; 5, using nails that are split,
incomplete, badly formed and bevelled, and too large; 6, starting nails
too deep or with the bevel on the outside, or drawing them too tight.
As occasional causes may be mentioned: 7, old nail-stubs in the horn;
8, walls that are very thin or broken away; 9, a soft, crumbling wall,
which alters the sound and feeling of the nail as it is driven, and
makes it difficult to judge of its course; 10, restlessness of the
animal while being shod.</p>

<p><i>Examination.</i>—Press with the hoof-testers upon the sole and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
clinches; tap lightly upon the clinches. If these acts cause pain,
there can be little doubt that the nail is responsible for the damage.
Remove the shoe by drawing each nail separately and carefully. Examine
the nails with reference to their direction and size, as well as to
staining with blood, blood-serum, or pus. Immediately after removing
the shoe, look for the point of entrance of each nail into the hoof,
and if a nail-hole be found upon the edge of the sole (<a href="#FIG_187">Fig. 187, <i>b</i></a>)
instead of in the white line, it is highly probable that the
nail which passed in at that place pressed upon the sensitive tissues
of the foot. Every nail-hole should then be searched by passing a clean
new nail into it and pressing its point towards the soft tissues at
various depths; any indication of pain caused by this act is pretty
sure proof of nailing. It stands to reason that the character of the
nail-holes in the shoe should be closely examined.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—When the foot has sustained an ordinary simple prick
with a nail, the latter should be left out and the hole well filled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
with wax. As a rule, no serious results follow. In severe direct
nailing the entire shoeing should be most carefully examined, and only
after everything is found to be right, and the shoe fits in such a
manner that the nails can only penetrate the wall from the white line,
can it be regarded as correct. The offending nail-hole is then to be
closed with wax. According to the intensity of the wound we may expect
a more or less pronounced inflammation of the pododerm, and this is to
be combated by resting the animal and cooling the foot.</p>

<p>If the wound is clean and recent, enlarging the opening in the horn by
cutting and boring can have no reasonable object; the wound by such an
act will not be made smaller, but larger.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, the wound is not observed or suspected until the
pain has become very intense (indirect nailing, nail-pressure); in
such cases the offending nail when withdrawn is apt to be covered with
pus or a dark, thin, ill-smelling liquid. In such a case the liquid,
whatever its nature may be, must be given free escape. In order to
accomplish this it is entirely sufficient to cut away a section of
the wall from the nail-hole outward, not greater than the width of
the little finger, and then to assist in the discharge of the pus
by placing the foot in a warm bath; it is entirely wrong, in fact,
reprehensible, to remove all horn of the wall and sole which has been
loosened from the soft parts by the suppurative process. After the
escape of the inflammatory fluids, the wall and sole will form the
best-fitting and most suitable protective dressing for the diseased
region until it has secreted new horn. If, after removal of the nail
and pus, the pain does not diminish, warm disinfecting baths of one to
two parts of creolin, or the same amount of lysol, to one hundred parts
of water at a temperature of about 90° F. will be of especial benefit;
they will not only soften the horn, but by their moisture and warmth
will directly diminish the pain and have a healing influence upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
suppurating surfaces. The warm baths must actually <i>be warm and be
kept warm</i>. Antiseptic solutions at room temperature are much less
efficient.</p>

<p>If the pain has not been very pronounced, or if it has been greatly
alleviated by two or three warm baths, then, as a rule, it is
sufficient to put a few drops of creolin upon the inflamed surface, and
to close the opening with oakum (carbolized oakum or carbolized cotton
is better).</p>

<p>The horse which has been nailed will be again perfectly serviceable
after a few days if shod with a shoe which does <b>not press</b> upon
the inflamed region. <i>The shoe does not press when it rests only
upon the bearing-edge of the wall, when the white line and the edge of
the sole are entirely free of the shoe, and no nails are driven in the
immediate vicinity of the wound.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"> Even though, as we have seen, nailing in the
great majority of cases is not particularly serious to the horse and
owner, yet we should never forget that tetanus (lockjaw), a disease
which is nearly always fatal to horses, may follow. Nailing, however
insignificant it may seem, may under conditions lead to the death of
the horse.</p>

<h4 id="VIII_2">2. Street-Nail.</h4>

<p>The <i>condition</i> caused by accidental injury of the sensitive
structures covered by the horny sole, such as the velvety tissue of
the sole and frog, plantar cushion, perforans tendon, navicular bone,
os pedis, or the pedal articulation, by sharp objects, especially
nails, is called “penetrating street-nail,” or simply “street-nail.”
The resistance of the ground to the weight of the body drives these
penetrating objects through the sole or frog into the foot.</p>

<p>Hind hoofs are more often affected than fore-hoofs. A favorite point of
entrance is the lateral lacuna of the frog. Street-nail is favored by
excessive thinning of the sole and frog.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>—The symptoms are, as a rule, sudden pain followed by
lameness. The first assistance is usually sought in the shoeing shop.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
If the cause of lameness be found to be a penetrating nail, piece of
glass, or other pointed foreign body, it must be <i>carefully drawn
out</i>, in doing which we should remove the <i>entire object</i>,
not allowing pieces to break off and remain in the wound. Since it is
always important to know in what direction and how deep the foreign
body has penetrated, in order to be able to estimate the gravity of the
wound, it is advisable in all cases to preserve the penetrating body,
that it may be shown to the veterinarian, in case his services are required.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="center">Shod hind foot, with splint dressing.</p>
</div>

<p>In slight injuries to the velvety tissue of the sole or frog,
accompanied with moderate pain, it is of no benefit to enlarge the
opening, though the horn of the sole or frog should be thinned for
the space of an inch or more around the wound, followed by cooling
applications. Deep, penetrating wounds accompanied with intense pain
require the attention of a veterinarian.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Often some form of dressing is necessary, and this is usually
held in place by a special shoe. For slight injuries, such
<i>splint-dressings</i> as are shown in <a href="#FIG_188">Figs. 188</a>
and <a href="#FIG_189">189</a> are sufficient. Whether such a dressing
be applied to the front or hind feet, the shoe should be <i>well
concaved</i> upon the hoof-surface. The dressing is held in place by
thin splints of tough wood, which are firmly wedged between the shoe
and hoof.</p>

     <p class="center">A practical “splint shoe” for hospital use.</p>
</div>

<p>In those rare cases in which it is necessary to maintain continuous
pressure upon the seat of the wound, and to protect the entire plantar
surface of the hoof, a <i>covered shoe</i> (<a href="#FIG_190">Figs. 190</a>
and <a href="#FIG_191">191</a>) is recommended. This shoe is provided
with a sheet-iron cover, having at the toe a spur which fits into a
corresponding hole in the toe of the shoe, and fastened at the heels by
means of screw heel-calks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<h4 id="VIII_3">3. Calk-Wounds of the Coronet.</h4>

<p>All tread-wounds of the coronet, caused by the calks of the opposite
shoe, by the shoes of other horses, or by forging, are known as calk
wounds, or simply as “calking.” The injury itself is either a bruise
or a bruised wound, followed by inflammation of the coronary cushion
and an interruption in the formation of horn at that point. It occurs
most often in winter from sharp calks, especially on the hind feet. The
common seat of the injury is the coronet of the toe and inner side of
the foot.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">

     <p class="blockquot">Shoe with cover-plate for street-nail
     treatment; suitable where pressure-dressing is desired:
     <i>a</i>, hole in the bottom of the toe-calk for reception
     of spur, <i>b</i>, of cover-plate; <i>c</i>, holes for
     reception of screw-calks, <i>d</i>, which fasten the
     cover-plate to the shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>The inflammation terminates either in resolution—that is, passes
gradually away, leaving the tissues apparently normal—or in
suppuration. The perioplic horn-band, which is usually loosened from
the perioplic band by the injury, does not again unite. For this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
reason, and because of the interruption in the formation of horn at the
seat of injury, there results a transverse depression or cleft in the wall.</p>

<p>The shoeing has to deal only with the lameness that may be present as
a result of the calking. The section of the wall containing the lesion
should be shortened, so that it will not press upon the shoe. Serious
calk-wounds, as a rule, require treatment by a veterinarian.</p>

<h4 id="VIII_4">4. Corns (Bruised Sole).</h4>

<p>The expression “corns” is applied to nearly all bruises of the pododerm
of the posterior half of the foot, with the exception of the frog,
which are apparent to the eye as yellowish, reddish, or bluish-red
discolorations of the horn of the sole and white line.</p>

<p>The surface of the pododerm (fleshy leaves and villi) is chiefly
involved, and almost without exception there is rupture of small
blood-vessels and an outpouring of blood between the pododerm
and the horn. The blood penetrates the horn-tubes and causes the
above-mentioned staining. By subsequent growth of horn these stained
patches are carried downward, and are finally uncovered and brought to
sight in paring the hoof.</p>

<p>The seat of corns is either on the fleshy leaves of the quarters, or on
the velvety tissue of the sole in the angle between the wall and the
bar, or on the fleshy leaves of the bars. Thus we distinguish <i>corns
of the wall, sole, and bars</i>.</p>

<p>Corns affect chiefly the front hoofs, and more often the inner half
than the outer. Unshod feet are seldom affected.</p>

<p>According to the intensity of the lesions we distinguish:</p>

<p>1. <i>Dry Corns.</i>—The red-stained horn is dry, and there is seldom
lameness.</p>

<p>2. <i>Suppurating Corns.</i>—They are the result of intense bruising
followed by inflammation. The pus is either thin and dark grayish
in color, denoting a superficial inflammation of the pododerm, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
yellowish and thick, denoting a deep inflammation of the pododerm. In
the latter case a veterinarian should be called. Lameness is usually
pronounced.</p>

<p>3. <i>Chronic Corns.</i>—In this case there is vivid discoloration of
horn in all possible hues. The horn is either soft, moist, and lardy,
or crumbling, cracked, and at times bloody. The inner surface of the
horn capsule has lost its normal character, and is covered with horny
swellings or nodules (<a href="#FIG_192">Fig. 192, <i>a</i></a>).
Sometimes the wing of the os pedis on that side has become morbidly
enlarged and loosened. A short, cautious gait alternates with
well-marked lameness; the latter appears whenever the shoe presses too
firmly on the corn, or when the hoof becomes too dry.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_192" class="f150">Fig. 192.</p>

     <p class="blockquot">Inner aspect of a quarter of a hoof,
         showing changes in the horn-leaves due to chronic corns:
         <i>a</i>, horny tumor resulting from the disease.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The causes</i>, aside from the form and quality of the hoofs
and the position of the limbs, lie in injudicious dressing of the
hoof and in faulty shoes. Too much trimming of wide and flat hoofs,
excessive weakening of the quarters, sole, bars, and frog of all other
hoofs, while the toe is usually left too long, are the usual causes.
Shortening one quarter too much in relation to the other, so that the
foot is unbalanced and the lower side overloaded, is a frequent cause.
Hollowing the sole and bars excessively and unnecessary thinning of the
branches of the sole in the search for corns are also causes.</p>

<p>Among faulty shoes we may mention those not level on the hoof-surface,
trough-shaped, too short in the branches, shoes which do not completely
cover the bearing-surface of the hoof, or whose bearing-surface at
the ends of the branches is directed downward and inward so that the
quarters are squeezed together when the weight is put on the foot.
Insufficient concaving of the shoe is often an exciting cause of corns
in flat feet and in those with dropped soles. A well-formed shoe which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
does not rest firmly upon the hoof, or which has been shifted as a
result of careless nailing, may as readily cause bruising of the
quarters as neglected shoeing. The latter causes, as a rule, corns of
the sole. It is very rarely that corns are caused by stones fastened
between the frog and branches of the shoe or in unshod hoofs by pebbles
becoming wedged in the white line.</p>

<p><i>Dryness</i> is particularly injurious to the hoofs, and is in the
highest degree favorable to the production of corns. It renders the
hoof stiff and inelastic, and first manifests itself by a short,
cautious (sore) gait when the horse is first put to work.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—First, removal of the causes, by restoring the
proper form to the hoof through shortening a toe which is too long
(especially apt to be the case in acute-angled hoofs), cutting down
quarters which are too high, and carefully removing all dead horn from
the branches of the sole, especially in acute-angled hoofs.</p>

<p>Deeply digging out a small area of blood-stained horn is injurious.
It is much better to thin the horn of the entire branch of the sole
uniformly, in doing which we should avoid wounding the velvety tissue
of the sole or drawing blood.</p>

<p>The proper shoe is the <b>bar-shoe</b>, except when both cartilages are
ossified. The pressure should not be taken from the quarters unless
they are sore.</p>

<p>When there is a <i>suppurating corn</i>, the shoe should be left off
several days. A <i>chronic corn</i> should be protected continuously
from pressure by the shoe. This is accomplished by using a bar-shoe
with leather sole. <i>A three-quarter shoe is not sufficient to
properly protect a hoof affected with a chronic corn, if the animal
must perform exacting labor on hard roads.</i></p>

<p>The care of the hoof consists in keeping it cool, moderately moist,
and pliant.</p>

<h4 id="VIII_5">5. Inflammation of the Heels.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the bulbs of the plantar cushion (heels) is usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
caused by such external influences as bruising. It occurs in both shod
and unshod feet. The symptoms are: increased warmth, pain and swelling,
sometimes infiltration of the tissues with blood, accompanied by a
short, cautious gait, or, if only one foot is affected, by well-marked
lameness.</p>

<p>The <i>most frequent causes</i> are: going barefoot upon hard (frozen),
uneven ground; shoeing hoofs having low heels with flat shoes that are
too short; sometimes too much frog pressure by the bar of a bar-shoe;
forging and grabbing.</p>

<p>The treatment first indicated is a cooling application in the form of
an ice-poultice, or a soaking in cold water. Later, astringent (drying)
applications are of benefit, especially if the perioplic horn-ring
has partially loosened from the bulbs of the heels; for example, a
weak solution in water of sulphate of copper (1 to 20), followed by
the application of a shoe with heel-calks, which is quite long in the
branches and <i>which must not press upon the wall of the quarters</i>.</p>

<h4 id="VIII_6">6. Laminitis (Founder).</h4>

<p>By this name we designate a peculiar inflammation of the pododerm at
the toe. It arises suddenly in well-nourished and apparently healthy
horses, following excessive work or long-continued rest in the stable,
and frequently leads to a decided change of form of the hoof.</p>

<p>The disease is always accompanied with intense pain. It most often
affects both front feet, more rarely all four feet, or only one foot.
In the first case the two front feet are planted far in advance of
the body, and the hind feet well forward under the belly. When all
four feet are affected, travelling is exceedingly difficult, often
impossible; in this case there is nearly always a high fever over the
entire body.</p>

<p>The seat of the disease is in the fleshy leaves about the toe, more
rarely upon the side walls and quarters. Depending upon the intensity
of the inflammation, the fleshy leaves are more or less loosened from
the horny leaves, as a result of which there is a change of position of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
the os pedis, with a simultaneous sinking of the coronet at the toe.
This produces a change of form of the hoof. The quarters become higher.
Rings form upon the wall, and their course is quite characteristic of
the disease. At the toe these rings are quite close to one another, but
as they pass back towards the quarters they gradually separate from one
another and recede from the coronary band (<a href="#FIG_193">Figs. 193</a>,
<a href="#FIG_194">194</a>, and <a href="#FIG_195">195</a>).</p>

     limit to which the toe may be rasped away in shoeing;

     height of the perioplic band; <i>h</i>, foot axis.</p>
</div>

<p>The wall at the toe is sunken just under the coronet; its lower
part, on the contrary, is thrust forward. <i>Later, the white line
becomes pathologically widened.</i> The horn of the white line is
dry, crumbling, and easily broken down, so that a break in continuity
(crack) is apt to occur between the wall and sole, and lead to the
formation of a <i>hollow wall</i> (“seedy-toe”). Where the inflammation
is moderate and is not repeated, healing usually takes place and the
horn grows down regularly and in normal direction from the coronet.
However, a rather brittle condition of the horn remains permanently.
If, on the contrary, the inflammation was very severe or repeated
several times, the horny sole becomes flat just in front of the point
of the frog as a result of the sinking of the os pedis, or it may even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
drop below the level of the wall (full hoof, dropped sole). Indeed, it
even happens at times that the toe of the os pedis perforates the horny
sole just in front of the point of the frog. The wall at the toe, which
was previously but little altered in form, is now thrust prominently forward.</p>

<p>The inflammation of the pododerm may under certain conditions and by
skilful veterinary treatment be removed, so that the characteristic
changes of form and quality of the hoof will not occur. But if this is
not accomplished, as is often the case, the disease will be obstinate,
and permanent morbid changes of the horn capsule take place.</p>

     when half worn out.</p>
</div>

<p>A horse in such a condition can be used, but the gait will be short
and stiff. The hoofs are shuffled forward and set heels first to the ground,
a manner of travelling that rapidly wears away the branches of the shoe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>In dressing a foundered hoof the outer circumference of the sole is
the guide. The thick projecting wall at the toe may be removed with
the rasp without injuring the foot. The sole should be spared, but the
quarters should be lowered to improve the setting of the foot to the
ground.</p>

<p>The choice of the shoe will depend upon the shape and nature of the
sole. If this is still concave, an ordinary shoe may be used. If,
however, the sole is flat or dropped, it must be protected by an open
shoe with a broad web, or with a bar-shoe (<a href="#FIG_197">Fig. 197</a>),
which is of especial value when the bearing-edge of the wall is weak
or broken away.</p>

<p>As long as there is pain on pressure about the toe there should be no
toe-clip, but two side-clips. The wall between these clips should be
lowered a tenth to an eighth of an inch to prevent pressure of the shoe
upon the sensitive tissues of the toe (<a href="#FIG_195">Fig. 195</a>).
The nails should be as small as possible and placed well back towards
the quarters. No nail should be driven in the wall at the toe when
there is separation of sole and wall at the toe (hollow wall,
seedy-toe).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>The shoes of horses affected with founder often work forward as a
result of the animals travelling upon their heels. To prevent this
evil, clips may be raised at the ends of the branches of an open shoe,
or one clip in the middle of the bar, in case a bar-shoe is used
(<a href="#FIG_197">Fig. 197</a>).</p>

<h4 id="VIII_7">7. Keraphyllocele<br /> (Horn Tumor).</h4>

<p>A keraphyllocele is a more or less sharply bounded horn tumor
projecting from the inner surface of the wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     border; <i>b</i>, plantar border; <i>c</i>, body of tumor;
     <i>d</i>, base of tumor presenting funnel-shaped opening
     discharging pus.</p>
</div>

<p>Its occurrence is rare. Its favorite seat is at the toe. It rarely
causes lameness. It can only be diagnosed with certainty when it
extends downward to the lower border of the wall. In this case there
may be seen a half-moon-shaped thickening of the white line which
rounds inward upon the edge of the sole, and is of a waxen color.
Frequently the horn at this place crumbles away, leaving a more or less
dark-colored cavity from which there sometimes escapes a small quantity
of dark-grayish pus.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—Chronic inflammation of the podophyllous tissue,
resulting from compression or bruising. Keraphyllocele frequently
follows a complete toe-crack of long duration, or a deep calk-wound at
the coronet.</p>

<p><i>Prognosis.</i>—Unfavorable, whether there is lameness or not. If
there is no lameness it is very apt to arise later, and if lameness is
already present it can only be removed by an operation, which should be
performed by a veterinarian. A return of the lameness following hard
work at a trot upon hard roads is always to be feared.</p>

<p><i>Shoeing.</i>—An ordinary shoe well concaved underneath the inflamed
region, which should be relieved of all pressure.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<span class="h_subtitle">DEFECTS OF THE HOOF.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 id="IX_A">A. Changes of Form.</h4>

<p id="IX_A_1" class="f120">1. <span class="smcap">The Flat and the
Full Hoof<br /> (Dropped Sole).</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Flat Hoof.</i>—A flat hoof is one whose toe and side
walls are <i>inclined very obliquely</i> to the ground-surface, and
whose sole is <i>on a level</i> with the bearing-surface of the wall.</p>

<p>It exists most often in horses bred in low-lying, marshy countries.</p>

<p>Frequently the frog is well developed, and projects considerably beyond
the level of the wall. The branches of the sole sink perceptibly under
the weight of the body, much more than in better-formed hoofs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_200" class="f150">Fig. 200.</p>
   <img src="images/i_182.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="218" />
     <p class="blockquot space-below2">Cross-section of a
     shod flat foot: <i>a</i>, sufficiently high bearing-edge
     of wall, and a horizontal bearing-surface on the shoe;
     <i>b</i>, insufficient height of bearing-edge of wall, and
     therefore a corresponding downward and inward inclination
     of the bearing-surface of the shoe.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Preparing the Hoof for the Shoe.</i>—The rule is to <b>spare</b>
the plantar surface of the foot. After removing from the sole
what little loose horn there may be, level the usually deficient
bearing-surface of the wall with the rasp. The outer border of the
wall, especially at the toe, should be rounded off rather more strongly
than usual, because the toe requires and will bear considerable
shortening. Outward bendings of the lower border of the wall should
be removed as far as it is practicable to do so.</p>

<p>The shoe, which should be rather wider in the web and thicker than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
usual, should have its bearing-surface shaped to correspond to the
bearing-surface of the wall; that is, if the bearing-surface of the
wall is below the margin of the sole (the sole of the foot being
uppermost), then the bearing-surface of the shoe should incline
downward and inward (<a href="#FIG_200">Fig. 200, <i>b</i></a>).
The bearing-surface of the branches, however, must always remain
horizontal. The shoe always requires deep concaving, especially along
the inner branch of the sole. If the quarters are weak, the walls
defective, or there are corns, cracks, loose walls, or other diseases
of the hoof, a <b>bar-shoe</b> should be selected.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Full Hoof</i> (Dropped Sole).—A full hoof is one whose
sole instead of being concave is convex,—that is, bulges beyond the
bearing-surface of the wall. It either arises gradually from a flat
hoof or is the result of laminitis (founder). In full hoofs the lower
surface of the os pedis is of the same shape as the horny sole.</p>

<p><i>The preparation of a full hoof</i> for the shoe consists merely
in removing all loose horn. In case the dropping of the sole is
very pronounced, the bearing-surface of the wall should be built up
artificially with Defay’s hoof cement. The shoe should be light, but
broad in the web, and furnished with a more or less deep concaving,
which extends from the inner edge of the web to the outer edge of the
shoe, and corresponds in shape to the bulging of the sole. By reason of
the deficiency of the wall, the <b>bar-shoe</b> deserves the preference
over an open shoe. It is frequently necessary to apply toe- and
heel-calks to remove the hoof from contact with the ground. The nails
should he thinner and longer than usual, and a more secure position of
the shoe may be secured without injury to the hoof by drawing up two
side-clips.</p>

<p>Flat and full hoofs are <b>incurable</b>. Shoeing is of benefit only in
rendering such horses serviceable. Soles that are soft and sensitive
should he smeared with crude turpentine or pine-tar, though unusual
sensitiveness calls for a leather sole. Horses with full hoofs should
not be driven faster than a walk over hard roads. During long-continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
spells of wet weather softening of these hoofs should be prevented by
smearing the soles with a hoof-ointment containing resin.</p>

<p id="IX_A_2" class="f120">2. <span class="smcap">The Upright or Stumpy Hoof.</span></p>

<p>The upright or stumpy hoof is that form in which the quarters, with
relation to the toe, are too long (too high). The wall at the toe
stands very steep, in some cases perpendicular, and is strongly worn
away by standing and travelling.</p>

     <p class="center">Beaked shoe for stilt-foot.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—1. The upright hoof is peculiar to the “standing under”
position (<a href="#FIG_53">Fig. 53</a>, page 66) and to the so-called
bear-foot (<a href="#FIG_70">Fig. 70</a>, page 72).</p>

<p>2. It arises also as a result of all those alterations in the direction
of the limbs which tend to remove the quarters from contact with the
ground (contraction of the flexor tendons, spavin,—<a href="#FIG_202">Fig. 202</a>).</p>

<p>3. It may arise gradually from neglect of the hoofs of horses running
barefoot.</p>

<p>4. It may arise from excessive shortening of the toe in relation to the
quarters.</p>

<p><i>Shoeing.</i>—The forms of hoofs mentioned in class 1 should be left
as they are. The hoofs that fall under class 2 should be dressed and
shod until a more natural setting down of the foot is secured. This
is brought about by sparing the quarters, and applying a shoe with
thickened branches or with heel-calks. Where the service of the animal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
is exacting and upon hard streets, the toes, especially of the hind
shoes, may be made more durable by welding in steel plates. Besides,
the shoe should be moderately <i>base-wide</i> around the toe,—that
is, should be bevelled downward and outward, should have a <i>strong
toe-clip</i>, and should be <i>quite concave at the toe</i> and
<i>rolled</i>. (<a href="#FIG_203">Figs. 203</a> and <a href="#FIG_204">204</a>).
Should the hoof tip forward whenever the weight is thrown upon the
limb, a shoe with a spur projecting from the centre of the toe, and
turning back and pressing upon the wall just underneath the coronary
band, will be of service (<a href="#FIG_202">Fig. 202</a>).</p>

<p>Only those upright hoofs which are the result of the causes mentioned
in 3 and 4 are to be dressed as ordinary hoofs, and if the service
required is not too exacting they should be shod with tips (<a href="#FIG_201">Fig. 201</a>),
or with shoes with thinned branches.</p>

<p id="IX_A_3" class="f120">3. <span class="smcap">The Contracted Hoof.</span></p>

<p><i>A hoof which has deviated from its normal form in such a manner that
its posterior half, either in part or as a whole, is too narrow, is a
contracted hoof.</i> The walls of the quarters assume an abnormally
oblique direction downward and inward towards the median line of the hoof.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>When contraction affects only one quarter, it is called <i>unilateral
contraction</i>, or abnormal wryness (<a href="#FIG_211">Fig. 211</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     horn prolonged from the buttress, which compresses the
     frog; <i>b</i>, narrow median lacuna of the frog.</p>
</div>

<p>The buttresses are usually very much prolonged and press upon the frog
and cause it to shrink. The bars no longer run in the natural straight
direction from the point of the frog backward and outward, but describe
a circle passing outward, backward, and inward.</p>

         toe to weaken the shoe;<br /> <i>B</i>, screw for expanding<br />
         the Defay’s shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>Contraction affects front feet, especially those of the
<i>acute-angled</i> form, more often than hind feet. In order to
determine whether or not a hoof is too narrow, we should always examine
the frog and its lateral lacunæ. If the frog is small and narrow, and
the lateral lacunæ very narrow and deep, there can be no doubt but that
the hoof is too narrow (contracted).</p>

<p><i>The causes</i>, aside from too little exercise, are chiefly errors
in shoeing, such as weakening the posterior half of the hoof, leaving
too long a toe, either neglecting to remove the spurs of horn which
grow from the buttresses and press upon the frog, or removing them
incompletely, and using shoes whose branches are either <i>too wide
apart</i> or are inclined downward and inward, so that under the weight
of the body <i>the heels are squeezed together</i> and contraction is favored.</p>

<p><i>Prevention and Treatment.</i>—First, it should be borne in mind
<i>that whatever exercises moderate pressure upon the sole, frog, and
bars tends to expand the hoof</i>. The action and value of the various
shoes, frog-, and sole-pads, are measured by this rule. For this reason
a shoe with heel-calks is never advisable if an open flat shoe without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
other means of relief can be used. Furthermore, since contraction is
the parent of nearly all diseases of the hoof (corns, quarter-cracks,
bar-cracks, thrush of the frog), we should use the greatest care to
<b>prevent</b> it by dressing the hoof as described on pages 98 to
103, using flat shoes with a <b>horizontal bearing-surface for the
quarters</b>, giving <b>abundant exercise, preventing drying out of the
horn</b>, and allowing the animal to go barefoot whenever possible.
<i>Where the contraction is but slight</i> the foregoing rules will be
found sufficient.</p>

<p><i>In very pronounced contraction, where the hoof is not acute-angled,
an expansive shoe</i> with clips raised at the ends of the branches to
press against the buttresses may prove very advantageous; but under
no conditions should violence be used in expanding the heels with the
expanding-screw. This is an act of extreme delicacy, and should be
performed only by experienced veterinarians.</p>

<p><i>In very pronounced contraction of one or both quarters of hoofs of
every degree of obliquity</i> we may obtain a continuous expansive
action by the use of one of the numerous V-shaped springs, of which the
<i>Chadwick spring</i> is the best (<a href="#FIG_207">Fig. 207</a>
and <a href="#FIG_208">208</a>). After levelling
the wall and thinning the branches of the sole, the points of the
spring are set against the <b>buttresses</b>, the apex of the spring
moved to and fro till the points have bored well into the horn, when
the apex is laid against the sole at the toe, the sole filled with tar
and oakum and covered by a leather sole, and a bar-shoe applied. If the
contraction be less pronounced, or if the frog be much shrunken we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
place a Chadwick spring beneath a rubber bar-pad with a short shoe. The
spring may be stiffened from shoeing to shoeing, first by introducing
the ferrule at the apex of the spring and later by shifting the ferrule
toward the shoulder (<a href="#FIG_207">Figs. 207, <i>b</i></a>, and

leather sole with foot-packing with or without a buttress spring.
A foul frog should be properly cleansed, and then disinfected with
pine-tar thinned with alcohol or crude wood-vinegar (pyroligneous acid).</p>

<p>Further curative measures are: turning the horse out without shoes
(expensive and seldom practicable); applying tips; using shoes the
bearing-surface of whose branches inclines downward and outward
(unilateral contraction requires but one branch to be so constructed);

Special forms of contraction are distinguished, and are as follows:</p>

<p id="IX_A_3_A">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Contraction of Wide Hoofs.</i>—This contraction
is manifest as a concavity or groove in the wall just below the coronet,
usually at the quarters, though sometimes extending entirely around
the foot parallel to the coronary band (<a href="#FIG_209">Fig. 209</a>).
Pain is produced in the contracted area by lightly tapping the horn, but
not by moderate pressure with the hoof-testers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="blockquot space-below2">Wide fore-hoof with “coronary
         contraction”: (<i>a</i>) broad shallow groove in each quarter,
         and disappearing toward the toe.</p>
</div>

<p>Green horses with wide hoofs, just from the pasture, are particularly
liable to this form of contraction. As a rule, the lameness does not
disappear completely until the wall has assumed its natural, straight
direction by growing down properly from the coronary band.</p>

<p>In dressing the hoof and applying the <i>bar-shoe</i>, care must be
taken that the lower border of the wall underneath the painful area is
lowered so much that it will not receive direct pressure from the shoe.</p>

<p id="IX_A_3_B">(<i>b</i>) <i>Contraction of the Sole.</i>—This is accompanied by an
unnatural direction of the wall. Instead of the wall being straight
from the coronet to the shoe, it describes a curve whose convexity
is outward (keg-shaped, claw-shaped when seen from the side) (<a href="#FIG_210">Fig. 210</a>).
The hoof seems constricted (tied in) at the coronet and at its
plantar border, the sole is abnormally concave (arched), and the
plantar surface of the hoof is considerably shortened from toe to
heel. It happens in both shod and unshod horses, with otherwise strong
hoofs, but is quite rare. It is occasionally associated with navicular
bursitis (“navicular disease”).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—Principally dryness, too little exercise, and shoes
without horizontal bearing-surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_210" class="f150">Fig. 210.</p>

     in profile; <i>b</i>, shoe fitted full all around, and
     “bearing-surface” inclining outward; <i>c</i>, outer border
     bevelled base-wide.</p>
</div>

<p>The treatment is correspondingly simple: The shoes should be flat,
fitted full all around to coax the wall out at every point, and the
outer border bevelled base-wide, so as to furnish a base of support
that is wider and longer than the hoof. In moderate contraction of the
sole, the bearing-surface of the shoe should be perfectly horizontal,
but if the contraction be very pronounced, the entire bearing-surface
should incline downward and outward (even at the toe). No toe-or
side-clip should be used. The shoe should be reset every two weeks; the
sole kept so thin by paring that it will spring under thumb pressure,
and kept moist by washing, tubbing or “stopping,” and the animal given
moderate exercise daily.</p>

<p><i>In all forms of contraction of the hoof abundant exercise and the
maintenance of the natural pliancy of the horn by daily moistening
(washing) with water are absolutely necessary for successful
treatment.</i></p>

<p id="IX_A_4" class="f120">4. <span class="smcap">The Wry Hoof.</span></p>

<p>If one side wall and quarter is steep, and the other very slanting
or oblique, we term such a hoof a “wry hoof.” Such a hoof divided in
the middle line presents two very <i>dissimilar</i> halves. There are
three classes of wry hoofs: 1, normal wry hoofs (<a href="#FIG_63">see Figs. 63-66</a>);
2, pathological wry hoofs, or hoofs contracted in one quarter (<a href="#IX_A_3">see
contracted hoofs</a>); 3, wry hoofs which are the result of improper
shortening of the wall and of neglect in horses running barefoot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Only the second and third classes of wry hoofs require especial
attention. First, the more oblique wall must be cut down, and the steep
wall spared,—a procedure which differs essentially from that employed
in treating the first class, but is, nevertheless, entirely warranted,
because these second and third kinds of wry hoofs do not correspond to
the direction of the limb.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_211" class="f150">Fig. 211.</p>
   <img src="images/i_191.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="339" />
     <p class="blockquot space-below2">A wry right front foot of
     the base-wide class, viewed from behind. The bar-shoe is
     fitted full along the contracted inner quarter, and snug
     on the outside. The inner branch of the frog rests upon
     the bar of the shoe; the outer branch is free. The inner
     quarter from the last nail back to the frog is free of the
     shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to take weight from the steep wall, we use with advantage a
<i>bar-shoe</i>, which should be longer and wider than the hoof on
its contracted side. In other words, enlarge the base of support by
making the branch of the shoe broader. If an entire side wall and
quarter is contracted the branch of the shoe beneath must be broad, the
border bevelled base-wide, and the branch punched so deeply that the
nail-holes will fall upon the white line.</p>

<p>In old work-horses any sort of shoe may be used, though a flat shoe
serves the purpose best. If a hoof is wry from faulty paring, and we
cannot at once completely restore the proper relative slant of the two
walls by paring alone, we may use a shoe with a thicker branch for the
half of the hoof which is too low (too steep).</p>

<p>In colts such wry hoofs can often be cured only by shoeing. The shoe
employed for this purpose is so made that the branch underneath the
steep (contracted) wall is quite thick, but gradually thins away around
the toe to the end of the other branch. In strongly marked cases the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
thin branch may end at the middle of the side wall (a three-quarter
shoe). This method of shoeing shifts the body-weight upon the slanting
wall and restores the foot to its proper shape in from two to four shoeings.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—Unequal distribution of the weight in the inner and
outer halves of the foot, in conjunction with excessive cutting down or
wear of the steeper wall. All faults in shoeing which tend to produce
contraction of the heels aid in the formation of a wry foot, especially
when these faults directly affect the steep wall. Neglect of the colt’s
hoofs during the first years of life frequently lays the basis for wry
foot in later years. All wry feet are more susceptible to disease than others.</p>

<p>The amount or degree of wryness varies considerably. In a moderately
developed case the steep wall (usually the inner) will be drawn in
at the plantar border of the quarter, presenting a convex surface
between this border and the coronet, and the adjacent branch of the
frog will be more or less shrunken. In extreme cases the slanting wall
(usually the outer) will also be involved and bent in the opposite
direction,—<i>i.e.</i>, will be concave (dished) between coronet and
lower border (crooked hoof).</p>

<p><i>Prognosis.</i>—When the degree of wryness corresponds to the slant
of the foot-axis and the old shoe shows nearly uniform wear, the defect
is not directly injurious. In very pronounced “wryness,” however, with
thin, bent walls, a number of associated lesions, such as corns and
cracks, may be present and render the animal unfit for service upon
paved or macadam roads.</p>

<p id="IX_A_5" class="f120">5. <span class="smcap">The Crooked Hoof.</span></p>

<p>A crooked hoof (<a href="#FIG_212">Fig. 212</a>) is one whose walls (viewed from
in front or behind) do not pass in a straight, natural direction from the coronet
to the ground, but are bent in such a manner that the bearing-surface
of the wall in relation to the foot-axis lies either too far out or in.</p>

<p>It may occur on any foot, but is seldom strongly marked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—The causes are either long-continued leaving of
one-half of the wall too high, or the use of shoes shaped for normal
feet upon hoofs of the base-wide position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_212" class="f150">Fig. 212.</p>

     <p class="blockquot space-below2">A crooked right fore-hoof

     <i>f</i>, superfluous horn to be removed gradually with the
     rasp; <i>c e</i> and <i>g h</i> indicate the position of
     the shoe with relation to the hoof.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal part of the treatment is the proper dressing of the hoof.
The wall which is bent out at the middle and drawn in at the plantar
border is, as a rule, too high and too near the centre of the foot
(too narrow); the opposite wall, on the contrary, is too low and too
far from the centre of the foot (too wide). This explains the manner
in which the hoof should be cut down and rasped. The shoe must be laid
out as far as possible towards the side which is too high and narrow.
A straight edge placed against the high wall touches it only at its
middle. The distance of this line from the lower edge of the wall shows
us how far the surface of support—namely, the shoe—should be set out
beyond the horn. If the straight edge be placed against the opposite
wall, it will touch only at the coronet and at the plantar border,
showing that the wall is concave. The distance of the middle of this
wall from the straight edge shows us how much too wide this half of
the wall is at its plantar border, and how much of the outer surface
of the wall at its plantar border should be removed with the rasp. The
restoration of a crooked hoof to its normal form requires several shoeings.

<p id="IX_A_6" class="f120">6. <span class="smcap">Ossification
of the Lateral Cartilage<br /> (Side-Bone).</span></p>

<p>The ossification of a lateral cartilage (<a href="#FIG_213">Fig. 213</a>) consists
in a change of the cartilage into bone. Heavy horses are more frequently affected
than lighter ones. It most often involves the outer cartilages of the
forefeet, seldom both cartilages. Side-bones always interfere with the
physiological movements of the foot, and may, indeed, entirely suppress them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_213" class="f150">Fig. 213.</p>

     <p class="blockquot space-below2">A left fore os pedis

     lateral cartilage: <i>a</i>, dotted line shows normal line
     of union of cartilage with wing of os pedis; <i>b</i>,
     ossified portion (“side bone”). The unossified cartilage
     has been removed by maceration.</p>
</div>

<p>The disease can only be diagnosed with certainty after the upper part
of the cartilage has ossified. The coronet is then rather prominent
(bulging), and feels hard. The gait is short, and cautious, and
well-marked lameness often follows severe work. As <i>causes</i>, may
be mentioned predisposition in heavy lymphatic horses, and violent
concussion or shock due to fast work upon hard roads. The disease is
<i>incurable</i>.</p>

<p>A special method of shoeing is only necessary when the outer cartilage
is ossified and the quarter upon that side is contracted. After
removing the old shoe, whose outer branch is, as a rule, more worn away
than the inner, the outer wall will always be found too high, due to
the fact that there has been little or no expansion and contraction in
this quarter and, therefore, little or no wear of the horn against the
shoe. The hoof is therefore wry,—on the outside too high, and on the
inside too low. This shows us how the foot should be dressed so as to
obtain a proper base of support and a uniform wear of the shoe. The
most suitable shoe is a <i>flat shoe</i>, whose outer branch must be
wider than the inner. It is so applied that the inner branch follows the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
edge of the wall closely, while the outer branch must be full and
at the quarter must extend beyond the wall far enough to touch a
perpendicular line dropped from the coronet (<a href="#FIG_215">Fig. 215</a>).
The shoe must, therefore, be punched deep (coarse) on the outer branch
and fine on the inner. A side-clip must be placed on the outer branch,
because in time the outer half of the hoof will again be too high.
<i>Bar-shoes and rubber pads are injurious when both cartilages are
ossified</i>, but may be used when there is partial ossification of
<i>but one cartilage</i>, especially if corns are present.</p>

<p id="IX_B_1" class="f120">1. <span class="smcap">Cracks.</span></p>

<p>Interruptions of continuity of the wall extending in the direction of
the horn-tubes are known as cracks or seams. They have, according to
their location, degree, and extent, not only various names, but also a
varying significance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>—On the inner side of front hoofs, especially of
horses that stand base-wide; on hind hoofs, usually at the toe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <p id="FIG_216" class="f150">Fig. 216.</p>

     <p class="blockquot space-below2">Hoof exhibiting a coronary crack,
          a plantar or low crack, and a complete deep crack, the latter
          with a nail ready to be clinched.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Classification.</i>—According to location we distinguish
toe-cracks, side-cracks, quarter-cracks, and bar-cracks. Those cracks
which affect only the upper border of the hoof are called <i>coronary
cracks</i>; those which are limited to the lower border of the hoof
are sometimes designated <i>low cracks</i> (plantar cracks); while
those which are continuous from one border to the other are called
<i>complete cracks</i>. If the crack passes through the entire
thickness of the wall to the sensitive tissues underneath, it is called
a <i>deep</i> or <i>penetrating crack</i>, in contradistinction to the
<i>superficial crack</i> (<a href="#FIG_216">Fig. 216</a>).</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—There are many. Besides wounds of the coronet,
everything that impairs the elasticity of the horn, weakens the hoof,
and causes an overloading of one-half of the hoof. Furthermore, great
dryness and excessive work on hard streets.</p>

<p><i>Prognosis.</i>—This will depend upon the age, kind, and location
of the crack. A <i>low crack is without significance</i> unless it is
the remnant of an old coronary crack which has grown down. <i>Coronary
cracks</i>, on the contrary, <i>are more serious</i> because of the
lameness which often accompanies them, and especially on account of the
long duration of the healing process.</p>

<p>The borders of the crack <b>never</b> grow together, and healing can
only take place through healthy, unbroken horn growing down from the
coronary band.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Treatment of Coronary and Bar-Cracks.</i>—If
practicable, allow the affected horse to go barefoot; otherwise, the
use of the <b>bar-shoe</b> for <i>all cracks</i> is advised, because it
will continuously protect the diseased section of wall from pressure by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the shoe. If there are present still other diseases of the hoof (corns,
contraction, flat or full hoof), the addition of a leather sole with
packing will be most beneficial, not only in favoring the healing of
the crack, but also in improving the form of the hoof and in favoring
the cure of the other lesions. In all coronary cracks it is of
advantage to assist healing by fastening or immobilizing the borders of
the crack by one of the following methods:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. By rivets (nails), which pass across the crack through holes
previously drilled in the horn (<a href="#FIG_217">Fig. 217</a>).</p>

<p>2. By clamps or hooks, which by means of special pincers are forced
into pockets previously burnt into the horn on opposite sides of the
crack (<a href="#FIG_219">Fig. 219, B</a>).</p>

<p>3. By a thin iron plate placed across the crack and secured by small
screws, such as are used in wood (<a href="#FIG_220">Figs. 220</a>,
<a href="#FIG_221">221</a>).</p>

<p>4. By means of a bandage to last one shoeing.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Toe-crack</b> occurs most often in draught horses and most
frequently in the hind feet. In shod hoofs it starts at the coronary
border, and unless proper treatment is instituted soon reaches the
plantar border. Long toes and low quarters and excessive dryness of the
horn are predisposing causes. The exciting cause is usually forward
pressure of the upper end of the short pastern against the thin upper
edge of the wall of the toe. In the last part of the phase of contact
of hoof with ground the pasterns are upright, or may even incline
downward and backward (foot-axis broken strongly backward), the short
pastern presses the coronary band firmly against the upper thin edge of
the toe, when if brittle through dryness it is unable to stretch and
tears asunder. Thus, under the effort of starting a heavy load, when a
horse with all four legs flexed has risen upon the points of his toes,
a short quick slip followed by a catch, will frequently start a crack
at the coronet.</p>

<p>The hoof should be so dressed and shod that the foot-axis shall be
straight when seen from the side. In hind feet it is admissible to
break the foot-axis slightly forward. Therefore, shorten the toe and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
spare the quarters. If the latter are deficient in length, raise them
by swelling the branches or by low heel-calks.</p>

<p>The shoe may be open, or a bar-shoe, or a short shoe with a rubber
frog- and buttress-pad. Whatever expands the quarters closes a
toe-crack. The Defay’s shoe (<a href="#FIG_206">Fig. 206</a>), or the
Chadwick spring beneath a rubber pad, or beneath a bar-shoe with
leather sole, if the frog be much shrunken, will be of service. The
shoe should fit air-tight, except for an inch or so on both sides of
the crack. Two lateral toe-clips (<a href="#FIG_217">Fig. 217</a>) are
drawn up, and the wall between these clips is cut down from a twelfth
to an eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>After the shoe has been nailed on tight the toe-crack should be
immobilized. The best method is by buried nails. Slots are burned or
cut on opposite sides at a distance of an inch from the crack. With a
spiral drill (<a href="#FIG_218">see Fig. 218</a>) bore a hole from a slot at

</div>

<p>A more rapid, though less efficient method of immobilizing a toe-or a
quarter-crack is by the use of the Vachette hook. A special apparatus
is required (<a href="#FIG_219">see Fig. 219</a>). The burning iron
(<a href="#FIG_219">Fig. 219, <i>A</i></a>) is brought to a yellow
heat, its end applied to the wall so that the two ears are on opposite
sides and equidistant from the crack, when it is pressed firmly till
the shoulder (<a href="#FIG_219">Fig. 219, <i>b</i></a>) touches the
surface of the wall. A Vachette hook, the distance between the points
of which equals the distance between the ears of the firing iron,
is seized by the special pincers (<i>C</i>), pressed into the slots
burned to receive it, and is then driven into the horn by compressing
the pincers. At the toe these hooks are frequently stripped off by the
heels of the opposite shoe (in hind feet). Free application of hoof
ointment, and maceration of the horn by melting snow or mud tends to
loosen them so that they often drop out.</p>

<p>An efficient method of fastening either a toe-or a quarter-crack is by
using a metal plate one-sixteenth (¹/₁₆″) of an inch thick, provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
with four to eight holes for the reception of screws four- to
five-sixteenths of an inch long. The plate is heated, bent to conform
to the curvature of the wall and pressed against the horn till it burns
a bed for itself, when it is screwed fast. It will not loosen (see
<a href="#FIG_220">Fig. 220, <i>b</i></a>). In every complete crack of the wall
the growing down of coherent horn is favored by thinning the horn for an inch on
both sides of the crack directly over the coronary band (<a href="#FIG_221">see Fig. 221, <i>a</i></a>),
so that any gliding movement between the sides of the crack
below can not be transmitted through the thinned area to the crack in
the velvety tissue of the coronary band. Cutting a “V” at the coronet
acts similarly, but is less efficient.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Quarter-crack</b> is usually associated with contraction of
the heels. It occurs on the inner quarter of base-wide (toe-wide)
hoofs, and rarely in the outer quarter of base-narrow hoofs. For
quarter-cracks we use a bar-shoe and determine the extent of the wall
to be laid free in the following manner: We imagine the crack to be
prolonged in the direction of the horn-tubes to the plantar border,
and drop a perpendicular line from the upper end of the crack to the
plantar border. That part of the plantar border lying between these two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
points is then to be lowered sufficiently to prevent pressure from the
shoe until the next shoeing (<a href="#FIG_220">Figs. 220, <i>a</i></a>,
and <a href="#FIG_221">221, <i>c</i></a>).</p>

<p>This method should be followed even when the perpendicular line falls
behind the buttress.</p>

<p>The crack may be immobilized by the metal plate, or by narrow ticking
bandage or adhesive tape wound a half dozen times around the hoof, in
conjunction with a bar-shoe, Chadwick spring, leather sole and tar and
oakum sole-packing.</p>

<p>In dressing the hoof, the side containing the crack should be spared,
the opposite side lowered, the object being to shift the weight and
consequent expansion into the sound quarter. When the affected quarter
is deficient in length the branch of the shoe beneath should be made
thicker, even to the extent of causing it to ground in advance of the
opposite branch.</p>

<p>Next to shoeing, rubber hoof-pads render good service, because through
them a part of the body-weight is distributed over the sole and frog.
They assist in widening the hoof, and lessen shock when the foot is set
to the ground. These are all matters which favor the growing down of
unbroken horn.</p>

<p>When the crack gaps widely, and the frog is small and deep in the foot
<i>a shoe with bar-clips</i> (Defay’s shoe), or a Chadwick spring, with
bar-shoe and leather sole may be used. It is not impossible, indeed,
to obtain a cure by using an ordinary open flat shoe, though much will
depend upon the other lesions that may be present, the nature of the
hoof, and the service required of the animal.</p>

<p>If the edges of the crack are irregular and overlapping, they should
be carefully thinned away. Thinning the horn on both sides of the crack
over the coronary band, preventing drying out of the horn, and frequent
applications of carbolized oil to the coronet favor growth of undivided
horn and guard against a renewal of the crack.</p>

<p>If in the beginning of the disease there is inflammation and lameness,
cooling poultices should be used for several days. When there is no
lameness, the horse may be used for slow draft purposes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
 <i>Coach-and saddle-horses should be kept from fast work until sound horn
has grown down at least one-half of an inch from the coronet.</i></p>

<p><i>Bar-cracks</i> are usually the result of changes of position of the
quarters, and are just as frequently brought about by contraction as
by leaving the quarters too high. We see them almost entirely upon the
fore-hoofs. They seldom occur alone, but are usually accompanied by
corns. When the crack extends to the pododerm there is a superficial
inflammation of the pododerm and lameness. When treatment is not
promptly begun the inflammation extends to the deeper layers of the
pododerm, or, indeed, even to the plantar cushion, and gives rise to
swelling of the bulb of the heel upon that side and to a well-marked
lameness, which requires treatment by a competent veterinarian.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a bar-crack is only found by a close examination of the
hoof after the shoe has been removed. In paring the hoof the crack
usually appears as a dark streak, sometimes as a bloody fissure; not
infrequently grayish hoof-pus is discovered in the depths of the crack.</p>

<p>The treatment must be directed towards favoring the growth of a
continuous (unbroken) bar. This is accomplished by completely removing
the edges of the crack, paring the horn of the vicinity very thin,
and preventing the least pressure upon the wall of this quarter by
the shoe, by lowering this quarter with the rasp and applying a
<b>bar-shoe</b> with leather sole.</p>

<p>Following the removal of the edges of the crack there often appears,
especially in stumpy hoofs, a deep groove; if the bottom of this groove
is moist, we should pack it with oakum wet with a five per cent.
solution of creolin or carbolic acid, and cover the oakum with wax
(grafting-wax). The cracks will return if the exciting causes cannot be
completely removed.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Treatment of Low Cracks (Plantar Cracks).</i>—These
cracks, occurring principally upon the hoofs of unshod horses, are
the result of excessive stretching and bending of the lower border of
the wall. Insufficient rounding of the wall with the rasp is largely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
responsible for them. An exciting cause in shod horses is the use of
too large nails in shoes that are punched too fine.</p>

<p>Every coronary crack becomes in time a low or plantar crack, and this
has an important bearing upon the prognosis, because a renewal of the
coronary crack will be followed by a low crack.</p>

<p>In order to remove these cracks it is sufficient merely to shoe the
horse. Upon shod horses they may be prevented by using properly punched
shoes and thin nails. The lower border of the wall near the crack
should be relieved of pressure by cutting out a half-moon-shaped piece
of horn. To prevent the crack from extending farther upward we may burn
a transverse slot at the upper end of the crack, in as far as the leafy
layer of the wall, or cut such a slot with a small hoof-knife.</p>

<p id="IX_B_2" class="f120">2. <span class="smcap">Clefts.</span></p>

<p>An interruption of continuity of the wall, at right angles to the
direction of the horn-tubes, is called a <i>cleft</i>.</p>

<p>Clefts may occur at any part of the wall; yet they occur most often
upon the inner toe and inner side, as a result of injury from sharp,
improperly placed heel-calks (<a href="#Page_173">see page 173</a>). However,
suppurating corns, or other suppurative processes situated at the coronet or
which find their point of escape at the coronet, may from time to time lead
to separations of continuity and the formation of horn-clefts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="center space-below2">Hoof with clefts of the toe and side wall.</p>
</div>

<p>Horn-clefts, though the result of lesions which are often very
injurious and interfere with the use of the horse, are of themselves
not an evil which can be abolished or healed by shoeing, although, in
many cases, proper shoeing would have prevented them. A horn-cleft is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
not a matter for consideration by the shoer until it has grown down so
far that it comes within the region of the nails.</p>

<p>In order not to disfigure the hoof unnecessarily, the horn below the
cleft should be kept in place as long as possible by shortening the
wall at that point, to remove shoe-pressure, and by driving no nails
into it. If, however, the horn is loose and about to come away, it
should be removed and the defect filled with Defay’s patent horn-cement.</p>

<p id="IX_B_3" class="f120">3. <span class="smcap">Loose Wall.</span></p>

<p>Separation of the wall from the sole <i>in the white line</i> is called
loose wall (<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223, <i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>—Frequent on the fore-hoofs of shod and unshod
horses, and oftener upon the inner than upon the outer side. More
rare on hind hoofs. Common-bred horses with wide and flat feet are
predisposed to this trouble.</p>

<p>We distinguish <i>superficial</i> and <i>deep loose wall</i>; only the
latter requires the shoer’s attention, because it leads to lameness.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—Walls which are very oblique (slanting); outward
bendings of the plantar border of the wall; burning the horn with hot
shoes; dryness; neglected shoeing; excessive softening of the horn with
poultices, particularly of cow-dung; carelessness in preparing the
bearing-surfaces of hoof and shoe in shoeing; uneven fitting of the shoe.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—It aims to remove the lameness and to favor growth
of coherent horn. In the first place the removal of the exciting
causes, followed by proper shortening of the wall. We should apply
a shoe whose bearing-surface <i>inclines slightly downward and
inward</i>, is perfectly smooth, and wide enough to cover the wall,
white line, and outer border of the sole; the iron should be only
moderately warm. Where there is lameness we use a leather sole with
packing, or a <b>bar-shoe</b>. The loose wall should be freed from
shoe-pressure only when it does not extend far along the white line.
When the separation is extensive the loose wall should not be lowered.
The crack should be filled with wood-tar, crude turpentine, or soft
grafting-wax.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>If a loose wall occur upon the foot of a horse while running barefoot,
all separated horn should be removed; if, on account of the nature of
the ground, this seems to be impracticable, the hoof must be shod.</p>

<p><i>Care of the Hoof.</i>—Shoe at least every four to five weeks.
Preserve the pliancy and toughness of the horn by judicious moistening.</p>

<p id="IX_B_4" class="f120">4. <span class="smcap">Hollow Wall.</span></p>

<p>A <i>hollow wall is one in which a separation has occurred between the
middle layer of the wall and the keraphyllous layer</i>. This crack or
separation always extends in the direction of the layers of the wall
(<a href="#FIG_223">Fig. 223, <i>b</i></a>).</p>

          section of a hoof<br /> showing (<i>a</i>) loose wall and
         (<i>b</i>) hollow wall.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Occurrence.</i>—Quite rare.</p>

<p>We should suspect a hollow wall when a part of the wall <i>rounds out
prominently beyond the rest</i>, and gives forth a hollow (resonant)
sound when struck. The white line presents a crack, yet we should
hesitate to form a conclusion as to the extent of the separation from
the extent of the crack along the white line, since the latter may be
considerably smaller. The separation extends higher up the wall than
in the case of loose wall, frequently to the coronet. The cavity is
usually filled with crumbling, disintegrated horn.</p>

<p>Hollow wall is not often accompanied by pain. Lameness may arise,
however, if the hollow section of wall assists in bearing the
body-weight, and if the animal does fast work upon paved streets.</p>

<p><i>Causes.</i>—Mechanical influences resulting in chronic inflammation
of fleshy leaves.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—A cure is possible, but requires considerable time.
In shoeing, which should always aim to <i>relieve pressure</i> from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
hollow section of wall, we cleanse the cavity and fill it with oakum
and tar, crude turpentine, or wax. Where the separation is very
extensive we use a <i>bar-shoe</i>.</p>

<p>The time required for complete cure of hollow and loose walls will
depend upon the height of the separation (see growth of the hoof,
<a href="#Page_82">page 82</a>).</p>

<p id="IX_B_5" class="f120">5. <span class="smcap">Thrush of the Frog.</span></p>

<p>When the horny frog is ragged and fissured, and an ill-smelling,
dark-colored liquid collects in the lacunæ of the frog, it is affected
with thrush. When thrush exists uninterruptedly for several months the
perioplic band is irritated and forms rings of periople which assume an
irregular course and cross the rings of the middle layer of the wall
(<a href="#FIG_224">Fig. 224</a>).</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">SHOEING MULES, ASSES, AND OXEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p>1. The shoeing of mules and asses is, as in the case of horses, a
necessity if these animals are to be used for draft or saddle purposes
on hard streets. The structure and characteristics of the hoofs of
these animals are quite similar to those of the horse, differing
chiefly in the form and thickness of the wall. The mule hoof is long
and narrow and round at the toe, the sole is well arched, and the side
walls are rather steep (<a href="#FIG_225">Fig. 225</a>). In the ass the
narrowness of hoof is still more pronounced, the wall is relatively
<b>thick</b>, the frog is particularly well developed in its branches,
and therefore the hoof is relatively wide in the region of the
quarters. The horn of both mule and ass is tough.</p>

<p>The shoes differ from those of the horse in no other respect than that
they should be lighter and narrower. Four nail-holes are sufficient for
an ass’ shoe, and five to six for a mule’s.</p>

<p>On account of the hardness and toughness of the walls, we use nails
that are short but strong in the shank; nails with weak shanks are apt
to bend in driving.</p>

     <p class="center">A shod ox-claw.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p id="X_2">2. <i>The shoeing of oxen</i> is essentially different from that
of horses, because the foot of the ox is cloven (split), the long pastern,
short pastern, and hoof-bone are double, so that, instead of one hoof
or claw, there are two upon each foot, distinguished as outer and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
inner. Each claw consists of wall, sole, and bulbs; the frog is absent.
The wall is considerably thinner than that of the horse’s hoof, the
sole is thin, and the bulbs are low. For these reasons the shoe
designed for a claw must be thin, but wide.</p>

<p>The holes must be punched fine and the nails be quite short and strong.
On each shoe a long tongue should be made on the inner edge near the
toe, and so directed that it can be turned upward and outward to
embrace the toe of the claw. A small clip raised on the outer toe of
each shoe will increase its stability. In some parts of Saxony the
shoes are so made that the tongue of each shoe begins in the rear
third of its inner edge and runs forward, upward, and outward, closely
embracing the wall of the toe. The smaller clip is drawn up on the
outer edge of the shoe close to the toe. These shoes are more difficult
to make, but when applied sit more firmly and remain fast longer than
all others. Machine-made ox shoes (<a href="#FIG_227">Fig. 227</a>) have no clip at the inner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
toe, and are frequently pulled and lost. For this reason they are
inferior to hand-made shoes. An undivided shoe (the so-called “closed
claw-shoe”) is unsuitable for oxen, because it deprives both claws of
their natural, free movements. However, such a shoe is of advantage
for heavy draft over hard and very rough roads, because it lessens the
liability of the fetlock and coronary joints and the cleft of the claws
to strains.</p>

</div>

<p>Great difficulty is often encountered in holding the feet during the
operation of shoeing. It is necessary to fasten the head securely
against a tree, post, or wall. A front foot may be raised and held
by passing a slip-noose in the end of a rope or side-line around the
fetlock and carrying the line over the withers to the opposite side,
where it is held by an assistant. A hind limb may be controlled by
passing a round pole in front of the hock of the leg to be raised,
and, with a man at each end of the pole, carrying the limb backward
and upward, in which position it is held; or the limb may be bent and
controlled by tightening a twitch or tourniquet upon the leg just above
the hock (<a href="#FIG_228">Fig. 228</a>). Oxen that continue to resist
may sometimes be quieted by light blows of a short stick upon the base
of the horns. In parts of the country where many oxen are shod stocks
are in common use.

<p>Very satisfactory stocks have been designed by Gutenaecker, of Munich
(<a href="#FIG_229">Fig. 229</a>). The four corner-posts (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>) are eight inches square and eight feet long, of which three
feet four inches are solidly implanted in the ground. They are united
by side- and cross-bars (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>). In front of
the corner-posts (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>) and in the middle line stands
a head-post (<i>e</i>) of the same dimensions as the corner-posts,
provided with a slot four inches wide and twenty inches long beginning
three feet from the ground. In this slot is a pulley-wheel (<i>i</i>),
and below it a windlass (<i>k</i>) for winding up the rope which is
tied around the base of the animal’s horns. The corner-posts are
provided with a slot (<i>n</i>) three inches wide and three inches
deep, within which are placed two movable side-bars (<i>o</i>,
<i>p</i>), which can be set at desired heights and fastened by iron
pins. Between the front and rear corner-posts of the right-hand side is
an eight-sided roller with a ratchet and click at one end, and having
on one of the sides six iron hooks, to which a girth is attached. On
the opposite side of the stocks, at the same height, is a stationary
bar (<i>f</i>) with six hooks (<i>g</i>, <i>g</i>) on the outer side.
The belly girth is six feet long, six inches wide, and terminates at
both ends in several strong cords two feet four inches long with iron
rings at their ends. Between the front corner-posts are a neck-yoke
(<i>h</i>) and a breast-bar which slide in the slots (<i>m</i>) and
may be fixed at desired heights by iron pins. On the rear face of each
rear corner-post is an iron bracket (<i>s</i>) one foot and a half
long, with a ring (<i>t</i>) six inches in diameter, through which
passes a round pole padded in the middle and kept in place by two iron
pins. Above each bracket is a hook (<i>u</i>) to which the end of the
breeching attaches.

     for breeching.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Before an animal is brought into the stocks the neck-yoke is raised,
the breast-bar lowered, and the girth left hanging from the hooks on
the stationary bar. The ox is then led into the stocks and the rope
which is tied around the base of the horns is carried over the pulley
(<i>i</i>), fastened to the hook on the roller (<i>k</i>), and wound up
till the head is tight against the head-post. The yoke and breast-bar
are then placed in position and fastened, the breeching hung on the
hooks (<i>u</i>), and the belly girth attached to the hooks on the
roller, so that, if need be, it can be shortened till it bears the
animal’s entire weight.</p>

<p>To control a front foot a slip-noose is placed about the fetlock and
the limb is raised and lashed to the side-bar, the rope passing finally
to the hook (<i>r</i>). To control a hind foot a slip-noose is placed
about the fetlock, the foot carried upward and backward over the rear
cross-bar, and, with the front surface of the fetlock-joint resting
against the padding of the bar, the limb is firmly secured by wrapping
the line several times about the limb and bar.</p>

<p>When no stocks are at hand, we may use an ordinary farm wagon or a
truck wagon. Tie the ox with his head forward between the front and
hind wheels. Fasten the large end of a binding pole to the spokes of
the front wheel and let it rest on the hub. Swing the pole close to the
ox and induce him to step over it with one hind leg, then raise the
rear end of the pole, and with it the leg and so much of the animal’s
hind quarters that the inner hind leg standing close to the wagon rests
but lightly upon the ground. The binding pole may then be slung with
a rope from the rack of the wagon or other stationary object and the
outer limb held in the usual manner. By following this method a shoer with
one assistant can easily and safely control the most refractory oxen.</p>

<b>In station of rest</b>, the normal position of a fore-leg, as seen
from the side, is somewhat different. The <i>station of rest</i> is the
position that is maintained with the least possible muscular effort.
With gradual muscular relaxation the head and neck sink to a point
somewhat below the line of the back, the top of the shoulder-blade
sinks a little, and the shoulder and elbow joints move forward till the
centre of the elbow joint is directly above the ground-surface of the
hoof. Therefore, when a horse <i>at rest</i> stands firmly on all four
feet, <i>the fore-leg</i> viewed from the side, <i>has a normal</i>
(regular) <i>direction, when a perpendicular line dropped from the
tuberosity of the acromian spine passes through the middle of the elbow
joint and meets the ground near the middle of the hoof</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a>
On a shoe we distinguish an <i>outer</i> and an <i>inner branch</i>.
The anterior portion, formed by the union of the two branches, is
called the <i>toe</i>. The upper surface, upon which the hoof rests,
is called the <i>hoof-surface</i>, and the under surface, which is
in contact with the ground, the <i>ground-surface</i>. That portion
of the hoof-surface which is in direct contact with the lower border
of the wall, the white line, and a narrow margin of the sole is
termed the <i>bearing-surface</i>, and when necessary “concaving”
(seating) extends from this to the inner border of the shoe. On the
ground-surface is seen the “fullering” or “crease.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a>
The horizontal bearing-surface is in accordance with nature, because
the changes of form of the hoof which take place at the plantar
border of the wall, on burdening and unburdening the foot, should not
be interfered with. A horizontal bearing-surface best fulfils this
requirement.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a>
Should lameness persist, it will be necessary to remove a strip of the
wall from the plantar border to the coronet in order to remove the
horn tumor. The fleshy leaves which have secreted the tumor must be
extirpated and the surface of the os pedis well scraped, or the growth
will return.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
